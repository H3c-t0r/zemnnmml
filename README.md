# ü§ñ Why ZenML?

ü§π Are you an ML engineer or data scientist shipping models to production and juggling a plethora of tools? 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Do you struggle with versioning data, code, and models in your projects? 

üëÄ Have you had trouble replicating production pipelines and monitoring models in production?

‚úÖ If you answered yes to any, ZenML is here to help with all that, and more.

Everyone loves to train ML models, but few talks about shipping them into production, and even fewer can do it well.
At ZenML, we believe the journey from model development to production doesn't need to be long and painful.

![The long journey from experimentation to production.](docs/book/assets/1-pipeline-hard-reproduce.png)


With ZenML, you as a data scientist can concentrate on what you do best - developing ML models, and not worry about infrastructure or deployment tools.

If you come from unstructured notebooks or scripts with lots of manual processes, ZenML will make the path to production easier and faster for you and your team.
Using ZenML allows data scientists like you to own the entire pipeline - from experimentation to production.

This is why we built ZenML. Read more [here](https://blog.zenml.io/why-zenml/).




# üí° What is ZenML?

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/book/assets/tailor.gif">
</div>


ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. It's built for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate as they develop to production. 

ZenML offers simple, flexible syntax, is cloud- and tool-agnostic, and has interfaces/abstractions that are catered toward ML workflows. 
With ZenML you'll have all your favorite tools in one place so you can tailor a workflow that caters to your specific needs.

![ZenML unifies all your tools in one place.](docs/book/assets/sam-side-by-side-full-text.png)

Read more on all tools you can readily use in the [integrations](https://zenml.io/integrations) section. Can't find your tool? You can always [write your own integration](https://docs.zenml.io/developer-guide/advanced-usage/custom-flavors) to use it with ZenML.


# üéÆ Features

</a>

# ü§∏ Getting Started

## üíæ Installation

> **Note** - ZenML supports Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.

ZenML is available for easy installation into your environment via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/zenml/):

```bash
pip install zenml
```

Alternatively, if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, try out the bleeding edge installation:
> **Warning** - Proceed at your own risk, no guarantees are given!
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml.git@develop --upgrade
```


ZenML is also available as a Docker image hosted publicly on
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenmldocker/zenml). Use the following
command to get started in a bash environment:

```shell
docker run -it zenmldocker/zenml /bin/bash
```


> **Warning** 
> #### Known installation issues for M1 Mac users
>
> If you have a M1 Mac machine and you are encountering an error > while trying to install ZenML, 
>please try to setup `brew` and `pyenv` with Rosetta 2 and then install ZenML. The issue arises because some of the dependencies 
>aren‚Äôt fully compatible with the vanilla ARM64 Architecture. The following links may be helpful (Thank you @Reid Falconer) :
>
>- [Pyenv with Apple Silicon](http://sixty-north.com/blog/pyenv-apple-silicon.html)
>- [Install Python Under Rosetta 2](https://medium.com/thinknum/how-to-install-python-under-rosetta-2-f98c0865e012)

## üöÖ Quickstart

Let's start by creating a simple pipeline that does the following - 
1. Loads the [digits dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits).
2. Trains a scikit-learn classifier to classify the images from the dataset.
3. Evaluates the classifier accuracy on a test set.

### Step 1: Initialize a ZenML repo
In your terminal run

```bash
zenml init
```

This creates a `.zen` folder in your current directory to store the necessary `zenml` configurations.

### Step 2: Installing the Scikit-learn integration
We will be using a classifier model from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), so let's install the `sklearn` integration.

```bash
zenml integration install sklearn -y
```

### Step 3: Defining steps and running the pipeline.
In ZenML, steps and pipelines are defined using Python decorators.
Put a `@step` or `@pipeline` decorator above a function to define a `step` or `pipeline`.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import ClassifierMixin

from zenml.integrations.sklearn.helpers.digits import get_digits, get_digits_model
from zenml.pipelines import pipeline
from zenml.steps import step, Output

# Steps definition
@step
def importer() -> Output(
    X_train=np.ndarray, X_test=np.ndarray, y_train=np.ndarray, y_test=np.ndarray
):
    """Loads the digits array as normal numpy arrays."""
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = get_digits()
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test


@step
def trainer(
    X_train: np.ndarray,
    y_train: np.ndarray,
) -> ClassifierMixin:
    """Train a simple sklearn classifier for the digits dataset."""
    model = get_digits_model()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model


@step
def evaluator(
    X_test: np.ndarray,
    y_test: np.ndarray,
    model: ClassifierMixin,
) -> float:
    """Calculate the accuracy on the test set"""
    test_acc = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
    return test_acc

# Pipeline definition
@pipeline
def mnist_pipeline(
    importer,
    trainer,
    evaluator,
):
    """Links all the steps together in a pipeline"""
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = importer()
    model = trainer(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train)
    evaluator(X_test=X_test, y_test=y_test, model=model)


pipeline = mnist_pipeline(
    importer=importer(), # Step 1
    trainer=trainer(), # Step 2
    evaluator=evaluator(), # Step 3
)

# Run the pipeline locally.
pipeline.run()
```

This runs the pipeline locally on your machine following the steps defined in the pipeline.
You can scale this up to run on a full-fledged cloud platform by [switching stacks](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/core-concepts) with minimal (or no) code changes!

# ü™ú Get a guided tour with `zenml go`

For a more in-depth introduction to ZenML, taught through Jupyter
notebooks, install `zenml` via pip as described above and type:

```shell
zenml go
```

This will spin up a Jupyter notebook that showcases the above example plus more
on how to use and extend ZenML.

# üç∞ ZenBytes

ZenBytes is a series of short practical MLOps lessons through ZenML and its various integrations. 
It is intended for people looking to learn about MLOps generally, and also for ML practitioners who want to get started with ZenML.

After you've run and understood the example in [Quickstart](#üöÖ-quickstart), your next port of call is probably either the [fully-fleshed-out quickstart
example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/quickstart) and
then to look at [the ZenBytes repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes)
and notebooks.

# üóÇÔ∏è ZenFiles

ZenFiles are production-grade ML use-cases powered by ZenML. They are fully
fleshed out, end-to-end, projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can
also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.

The ZenFiles project is fully maintained and can be viewed as a sister
repository of ZenML. Check it out [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenfiles).

# üë≠ Collaborate with your team

ZenML is built to support teams working together. The underlying infrastructure
on which your ML workflows run can be shared, as can the data, assets and
artifacts that you need to enable your work. ZenML Profiles offer an easy way to
manage and switch between your stacks. The ZenML Server handles all the
interaction and sharing and you can host it wherever you'd like.

```
# Make sure to install ZenML with all necessary requirements for the ZenServer
pip install zenml[server]
zenml server up
```
