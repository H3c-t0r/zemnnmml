# üè∑ Continuous Annotation with Label Studio

Data annotation / labeling is a core part of MLOps that is frequently left out
of the conversation. ZenML offers a way to build continuous annotation (combining
training and annotation into a loop) with Label Studio. This uses a combination
of user-defined steps as well as some built-in steps that ZenML provides.

## Basic guide to running this example

<!-- # TODO: CHANGE THIS FOR FRESH USER -->
Running this example on Azure is the quickest way to get going. You can use the
`annotationartifactstore` storage account and its
`annotationartifactstoretesting` blob container as a test artifact store.

Make sure to set the following two environment variables prior to running this
pipeline:

```shell
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<your_azure_account_key>
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your_azure_account_name>
```

Then make sure you've installed the relevant integrations and dependencies:

```shell
zenml integration install label_studio -y
pip install fastai huggingface_hub -Uqq
```

Setup your user credentials:

```shell
# choose a username and password for your label-studio account
label-studio reset_password --username <username> --password <password>
# start a temporary / one-off label-studio instance to get your API key
label-studio start -p 8094
```

Then visit
[http://localhost:8094/](http://localhost:8094/) to log in, then visit [http://localhost:8094/user/account](http://localhost:8094/user/account) and get
your Label Studio API key (from the upper right hand corner). You will need it
for the next step. `Ctrl-c` out of the Label Studio server that is running on
the terminal.

Then register your annotator with ZenML:

```shell
zenml annotator register label_studio --flavor label_studio --api_key="<your_label_studio_api_key_goes_here>"
```

Set up your (Azure) stack as follows:

```shell
# using the pre-built blob storage mentioned above
zenml artifact-store register azure_artifact_store --flavor=azure --path="az://annotationartifactstoretesting"
zenml stack copy default annotation
zenml stack update annotation -a azure_artifact_store -an label_studio
zenml stack set annotation
zenml stack up
```

This will initialize the daemon server which Label Studio requires, albeit
running on a default port of 8093.

Run the pipeline with:

<!-- # TODO: FIX THIS TO WORK WITH ZENML EXAMPLE PULL -->
```shell
cd examples/annotation_label_studio/
python run.py
```

Once the pipeline has run, you can go to
[http://localhost:8093/](http://localhost:8093/) and view the project. You can
do some labeling there and any annotations you make will be imported and used the next
time you run the pipeline.


(There are more elaborate steps required if you want to run this on AWS or GCP.)

## CLI Commands for the Label Studio Integration

Once you've run the pipeline for the first time, you'll be able to use some of
the ZenML CLI commands to interact with your Label Studio annotations and the
dataset:

```shell
# the obvious ones to try
zenml annotator describe
zenml annotator dataset list
zenml annotator dataset stats
```



## üó∫ Overview

The example pipeline is simple as can be. In our one and only step we access the
stacks active secret manager and
query for an example called `example_secret`. We then access the contents of
this secret and query the secret with the
unique key: `example_secret_key`.

Similarly, you would be able to pass access keys, password, credentials and so
on into your pipeline steps to do with as
you please.

# üñ• Run it locally

## üë£ Step-by-Step

### üìÑ Prerequisites

In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML.

```shell
# install CLI
pip install zenml

# pull example
zenml example pull annotation_label_studio
cd zenml_examples/annotation_label_studio

# Initialize ZenML repo
zenml init
```

### ü•û Set up your stack for Microsoft Azure

To get going with aws make sure to have your aws credential set up locally. We
recommend this
[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)
to make sure everything is
set up properly.

```shell
zenml integration install azure

zenml secrets-manager register aws_secrets_manager --flavor=aws
zenml stack register secrets_stack -m default -o default -a default -x aws_secrets_manager --set
```

### ü•û Set up your stack for GCP

To get going with gcp make sure to have gcloud set up locally with a user or 
ideally a service account with permissions to access the secret manager. 
[This](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk) guide should help you get 
started. Once everything is set up on your machine, make sure to enable the 
secrets manager API within your GCP project. You will need to create a project
and get the `project_id` which will need to be specified when you register the
secrets manager.

```shell
zenml integration install gcp

zenml secrets-manager register gcp_secrets_manager --flavor=gcp_secrets_manager --project_id=PROJECT_ID
zenml stack register secrets_stack -m default -o default -a default -x gcp_secrets_manager --set
```

### ü•û Set up your stack for Azure

To get going with Azure you will need to install and configure the 
[Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
with the correct credentials to access the Azure secrets manager.

```shell
zenml integration install azure

zenml secrets-manager register azure_key_vault --flavor=azure_key_vault --key_vault_name=<VAULT-NAME>
zenml stack register secrets_stack -m default -o default -a default -x azure_key_vault --set
```


### ü§´ Create a secret

Here we are creating a secret called `example_secret` which contains a single
key-value pair:
{example_secret_key: example_secret_value}

```shell
zenml secret register example_secret --example_secret_key=example_secret_value
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

Now we're ready. Execute:

```bash
python run.py
```

Alternatively, if you want to run based on the config.yaml you can run with:

```bash
zenml pipeline run pipelines/secret_loading_pipeline/secret_loading_pipeline.py -c config.yaml 
```

### üßΩ Clean up

In order to clean up, delete the example secret:

```shell
  zenml secret delete annotation_label_studio
```

and the remaining ZenML references.

```shell
rm -rf zenml_examples
```
