# Simply set these environment variables to point to a Whylabs account and all
# whylogs DatasetProfile artifacts that are produced by a pipeline run will
# also be uploaded to Whylabs:
#
# import os
# os.environ["WHYLABS_API_KEY"] = "YOUR-API-KEY"
# os.environ["WHYLABS_DEFAULT_ORG_ID"] = "YOUR-ORG-ID"


# An existing zenml step can be easily extended to include whylogs profiling
# features by adding the @enable_whylogs decorator. The only prerequisite is
# that the step already include a step context parameter.
#
# Applying the @enable_whylogs decorator gives the user access to a `whylogs`
# step sub-context field which intermediates and facilitates the creation of
# whylogs DatasetProfile artifacts.
#
# The whylogs sub-context transparently incorporates ZenML specific
# information, such as project, pipeline name and specialized tags, into all
# dataset profiles that are generated with it. It also simplifies the whylogs
# profile generation process by abstracting away some of the whylogs specific
# details, such as whylogs session and logger initialization and management.
#
# NOTE: remember that cache needs to be explicitly enabled for steps that take
# in step contexts
