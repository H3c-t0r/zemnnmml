# [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) sparse matrices in ZenML

An elementary data structure widely used in `sklearn` to store sparse data more efficiently.


## üß∞ How the example is implemented

We train a simple linear model to classify text based on sentiment.

The text is represented via a sparse [bag of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) vector.

# üñ• Run it locally

## ‚è© SuperQuick `scipy` run

If you're really in a hurry, and you want just to see this example pipeline run,
without wanting to fiddle around with all the individual installation and
configuration steps, just run the following:

```shell
zenml example run scipy
```

### üìÑ Prerequisites

In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML:

```shell
# install CLI
pip install zenml

# install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install scipy

# pull example
zenml example pull scipy
cd zenml_examples/scipy

# Initialize ZenML repo
zenml init
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Code

Now we're ready. Execute:

```bash
python run.py
```

### üßΩ Clean up

In order to clean up, delete the remaining ZenML references.

```shell
rm -rf zenml_examples
```
