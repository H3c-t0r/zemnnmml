# 🏃 Get up and running quickly
Our goal here is to help you to get the first practical experience with our tool and give you a brief overview 
on some basic functionalities of ZenML. We'll create a training pipeline for the 
[MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset.

If you want to run this notebook in an interactive environment, feel free to run it in a 
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb) 
or view it on [GitHub](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/quickstart) directly.

## 🗺 Overview
Here we train a simple sklearn classifier on the MNIST dataset.

# ☁️ Run in Colab
If you have a google account, you can get started directly with google colab - 
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/examples/quickstart/quickstart.ipynb)

# 🖥 Run it locally

### 📄 Prerequisites 
In order to run this example, you need to install and initialize ZenML:

```shell
# install CLI
pip install zenml

# install ZenML integrations
zenml integration install sklearn

# pull example
zenml example pull quickstart
cd zenml_examples/quickstart

# initialize
zenml init
```

### ▶️ Run the Code
Now we're ready. Execute:

```shell
python quickstart.py
```

Or just a jupyter notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook  # jupyter must be installed
```

### 🧽 Clean up
In order to clean up, delete the remaining zenml references.

```shell
rm -rf zenml_examples
```
