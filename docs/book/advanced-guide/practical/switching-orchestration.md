description: Switching orchestrators to run in the cloud
---

With Stack Recipes, you have everything you need to deploy production-grade
cloud stacks. Switching stacks is the product of a single CLI command:

```shell
zenml stack set <NEWLY_REGISTERED_CLOUD_STACK_NAME>
```

If you were running your pipelines on a local stack, you are now running on your
cloud stack. The steps to setup your cloud stack were quite numerous prior to
stack recipes, but now it's easy to both deploy and switch between your stacks.
In this way, you can iterate between your stacks as is appropriate for your
iterative process.
