# Things to change

I would propose merging the two pages referenced below as they both involve accessing info within a step

In addition to [Step Fixtures](./step-fixtures.md), ZenML provides another
interface where ZenML data can be accessed from within a step, the
`Environment`, which can be used to get further information about the
environment where the step is executed, such as the system it is running on,
the Python version, the name of the current step, pipeline, and run, and more.

As an example, this is how you could use the `Environment` to find out the name of the current step, pipeline, and run:
```
from zenml.environment import Environment


@step
def my_step(...)
    env = Environment().step_environment
    step_name = env.step_name
    pipeline_name = env.pipeline_name
    run_id = env.pipeline_run_id
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To explore all possible operations that can be performed via the
`Environment`, please consult the API docs section on
[Environment](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/api_docs/environment/#zenml.environment.Environment).
{% endhint %}

In general, when defining steps, you usually can only supply inputs that have
been output by previous steps. However, there are two exceptions:

* An object which is a subclass of `BaseParameters`: This object is used to
pass run-time parameters to a pipeline run. It can be used to send parameters
to a step that are not artifacts. You learned about this one already in the
section on [Runtime Configuration](../steps-pipelines/runtime-configuration.md).
* A [Step Context](#step-contexts) object: This object gives access to the 
active stack, materializers, and special integration-specific libraries.

These two types of special parameters are comparable to 
[Pytest fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html), hence we call
them **Step Fixtures** at ZenML.

To use step fixtures in your steps, just pass a parameter with the right type
hint and ZenML will automatically recognize it.

```python
from zenml.steps import step, BaseParameters, StepContext


class SubClassBaseParameters(BaseParameters):
    ...


@step
def my_step(
    params: SubClassBaseParameters,  # must be subclass of `BaseParameters`
    context: StepContext,  # must be of class `StepContext`
    artifact: str,  # other parameters are assumed to be outputs of other steps
):
    ...
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The name of the argument can be anything, only the type hint is important. 
I.e., you don't necessarily need to call your fixtures `config` or `context`.
{% endhint %}

## Step Contexts

The `StepContext` provides additional context inside a step function. It can be
used to access artifacts, materializers, and stack components directly 
from within the step.

### Defining Steps with Step Contexts

Unlike `BaseParameters`, you do not need to create a `StepContext` object
yourself and pass it when creating the step. As long as you specify a parameter
of type `StepContext` in the signature of your step function or class, ZenML 
will automatically create the `StepContext` and take care of passing it to your
step at runtime.

{% hint style="info" %}
When using a `StepContext` inside a step, ZenML disables caching for this step by
default as the context provides access to external resources which might
influence the result of your step execution. To enable caching anyway, 
explicitly enable it in the `@step` decorator with `@step(enable_cache=True)`
or when initializing your custom step class.
{% endhint %}

### Using Step Contexts

Within a step, there are many things that you can use the `StepContext` object
for. For example, to access materializers, artifact locations, etc:

```python
from zenml.steps import step, StepContext


@step
def my_step(context: StepContext):
    context.get_output_materializer()  # Get materializer for a given output.
    context.get_output_artifact_uri()  # Get URI for a given output.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
See the [API Docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/api_docs/steps/) for
more information on which attributes and methods the `StepContext` provides.
