description: How to collaborate with the ZenML community
---

Collaboration is a crucial aspect of any MLOps team as they often need to bring 
together individuals with diverse skills and expertise to create a cohesive 
and effective workflow for machine learning projects. A successful MLOps team 
requires seamless collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and DevOps 
professionals to develop, train, deploy, and maintain machine learning models. 
This can be a challenging task as it requires coordination across different 
tools, processes, and frameworks. 

This is where one of the biggest strengths of ZenML comes into play, a platform 
open to collaboration. This includes not just a collaboration platform within 
your team but with the ZenML community as well.

- With a deployed ZenML instance, users have the ability to create their own 
teams and project structures. They can easily share pipelines, runs, stacks, 
and other resources, streamlining the workflow and promoting teamwork.

- On the flip side, there's the ZenML Hub. Here, you can peruse a collection 
of community-driven solutions, share your own solutions, and collaborate with 
fellow members of the community.

This section will center on managing users, their roles, and permissions 
within a deployed ZenML instance, as well as exploring how the ZenML Hub 
integrates into the overall workflow.
