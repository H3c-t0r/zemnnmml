# ‚ùì FAQ

#### Why did you build ZenML?

We built it because we scratched our own itch while deploying multiple machine-learning models in production over the
past three years. Our team struggled to find a simple yet production-ready solution whilst developing large-scale ML
pipelines. We built a solution for it that we are now proud to share with all of you! Read more about this
backstory [on our blog here](https://blog.zenml.io/why-zenml/).

#### Is ZenML just another orchestrator like Airflow, Kubeflow, Flyte, etc?

Not really! An orchestrator in MLOps is the system component that is responsible for executing and managing the
execution of an ML pipeline. ZenML is a framework that allows you to run your pipelines on whatever orchestrator you
like, and we coordinate with all the other parts of an ML system in production. There
are [standard orchestrators](/docs/book/user-guide/component-guide/orchestrators/orchestrators.md) that ZenML supports out-of-the-box,
but you are encouraged to [write your own orchestrator](/docs/book/user-guide/component-guide/orchestrators/custom.md) in order to gain
more control as to exactly how your pipelines are executed!

#### Can I use the tool `X`? How does the tool `Y` integrate with ZenML?

Take a look at our [examples](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples) directory, which showcases detailed
examples for each integration that ZenML supports out-of-the-box.

The ZenML team and community are constantly working to include more tools and integrations to the above list (check out
the [roadmap](https://zenml.io/roadmap) for more details). You can [upvote features](https://zenml.io/discussion) you'd
like and add your ideas to the roadmap.

Most importantly, ZenML is extensible, and we encourage you to use it with whatever other tools you require as part of
your ML process and system(s). Check out [our documentation on how to get started](../introduction.md)
with extending ZenML to learn more!

#### How can I make ZenML work with my custom tool? How can I extend or build on ZenML?

This depends on the tool and its respective MLOps category. We have a full guide on this
over [here](/docs/book/platform-guide/set-up-your-mlops-platform/implement-a-custom-stack-component.md)!

#### How can I contribute?

We would love to develop ZenML together with our community! The best way to get started is to select any issue from
the [`good-first-issue` label](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/labels/good%20first%20issue). If you would like to
contribute, please review our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for all
relevant details.

#### How can I learn more about MLOps?

Check out our [ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) repository and course, where you learn MLOps concepts in
a practical manner with the ZenML framework. Other great resources are:

* [MadeWithML](https://madewithml.com/)
* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)
* [CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/)

#### How can I speak with the community?

The first point of the call should be [our Slack group](https://zenml.io/slack-invite/). Ask your questions about bugs
or specific use cases and someone from the core team will respond.
