# ‚òÅ ZenML Cloud





ZenML Cloud is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that extends the capabilities of the open-source ZenML product. It provides users with a centralized control plane to effortlessly launch and manage their ZenML instances. The core foundation of ZenML Cloud remains the powerful open-source offering, but with ZenML Cloud, users gain access to a host of additional features designed to streamline the machine learning workflow.

## Key features

#### 1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (In development)

ZenML Cloud introduces CI/CD capabilities that are seamlessly integrated with your code repository. This feature allows you to automate the testing and deployment of your machine learning pipelines. Whenever you push code changes to your repository, ZenML Cloud triggers CI/CD pipelines, ensuring your models are updated and deployed automatically, making the development process more efficient and reliable.

#### 2. Model Control WatchTower (In development)

With ZenML Cloud's Model Control WatchTower, you gain a comprehensive overview of all your models and deployments across different stacks. This central view offers full visibility and control, empowering you to monitor and manage your machine-learning projects efficiently. The Model Control WatchTower enables you to make informed decisions about model versions, deployments, and performance metrics.

#### 3. Integrated MLOps Stack&#x20;

ZenML Cloud comes built-in with Mlflow and will soon incorporate more managed MLOps stack components. Mlflow facilitates efficient experiment tracking, model versioning, and model management. Additionally, upcoming MLOps components will further enhance your workflow and simplify the end-to-end machine learning process.

#### 4. Seamless Cloud Integration

ZenML Cloud enables easy integration with various cloud platforms, allowing you to launch your MLOps stack directly in the cloud with minimal hassle. This feature eliminates the complexity of setting up infrastructure and ensures that your machine-learning projects run smoothly and efficiently in your preferred cloud environment.

#### 5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Single Sign-On (SSO) (In development)

ZenML Cloud enhances collaboration and security by providing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. These features enable you to manage permissions and access rights for different team members, ensuring that only authorized personnel can interact with specific resources. Additionally, user management functionalities allow you to easily onboard and manage team members within ZenML Cloud.
