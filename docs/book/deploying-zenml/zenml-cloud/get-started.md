## Step 1: Sign-Up

On the ZenML Cloud sign-up page, you will have the option to sign up using either your Google account or your GitHub account. Click on the respective button to proceed with your preferred sign-up method.

After successfully signing in with your Google or GitHub account, you will be asked to complete your ZenML Cloud profile. Provide any additional information required to set up your ZenML Cloud account, such as your name, email address, and organization details.

## Step 2: Automatic tenant creation

Upon completing the sign-up process, you will gain access to a free trial period lasting for 30 days. During this trial, a ZenML tenant will be automatically created for you. This setup process typically takes a few minutes to complete, and once it's ready, you will receive an email notification. This will mark the beginning of your 30-day trial, allowing you to explore and experience the benefits of ZenML's features firsthand.
