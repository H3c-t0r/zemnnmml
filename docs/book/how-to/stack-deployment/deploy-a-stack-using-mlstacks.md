# ‚öíÔ∏è Deploying stacks and components using `mlstacks`

The first step in running your pipelines on remote infrastructure is to deploy all the components that you would need, like an [MLflow tracking server](../../component-guide/experiment-trackers/mlflow.md),
[Kubeflow orchestrator](../../component-guide/orchestrators/kubeflow.md), and more to your cloud.

This can bring plenty of benefits like scalability, reliability, and collaboration. ZenML eases the path to production by providing a seamless way for all tools to interact with others through the use of abstractions. However, one of the most painful parts of this process, from what we see on our Slack and in general, is the deployment of these stack components.

[`mlstacks`](https://mlstacks.zenml.io/) is a Python package that allows you to quickly spin up MLOps
infrastructure using Terraform. It is designed to be used with
[ZenML](https://zenml.io), but can be used with any MLOps tool or platform. You
can deploy a modular MLOps stack for AWS, GCP or K3D using mlstacks. Each deployment type is designed to offer a great deal of flexibility in configuring the resources while preserving the ease of application through the use of sensible defaults.

To make even this process easier for our users, we have created the `deploy` command in `zenml`, which allows you to quickly get started with a full-fledged MLOps stack using only a few commands. You can choose to deploy individual stack components through the stack-component CLI or deploy a stack with multiple components together (a tad more manual steps).

Check out [the full documentation for the mlstacks package](https://mlstacks.zenml.io/) for more information.

## Deploy a stack using mlstacks

### When should I deploy something using mlstacks?

To answer this question, here are some pros and cons in comparison to the stack-component deploy method which can help you choose what works best for you!

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="üòç Pros" %}
* Offers a lot of flexibility in what you deploy.
* Deploying with `mlstacks` gives you a full MLOps stack as the output. Your
  components and stack is automatically imported to ZenML. This saves you the
  effort of manually registering all the components.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="üò• Cons" %}
* Currently only supports AWS, GCP, and K3D as providers.
* Most stack deployments are Kubernetes-based which might be too heavy for your
  needs.
* Not all stack components are supported yet.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The ZenML CLI has special subcommands that allow you to deploy individual stack components as well as whole stacks using MLStacks. These stacks will be useful for you if:

* You are at the start of your MLOps journey, and would like to explore different tools.
* You are looking for guidelines for production-grade deployments.

### Installing the mlstacks extra

To install `mlstacks`, either run `pip install mlstacks` or `pip install "zenml[mlstacks]"` to install it along with ZenML.

MLStacks uses Terraform on the backend to manage infrastructure. You will need to have Terraform installed. Please visit [the Terraform docs](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform) for installation instructions.

MLStacks also uses Helm to deploy Kubernetes resources. You will need to have Helm installed. Please visit [the Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script) for installation instructions.

### Deploying a stack

A simple stack deployment can be done using the following command:

```bash
zenml stack deploy -p aws -a -n basic -r eu-north-1 -x bucket_name=my_bucket -o sagemaker
```

This command deploys a stack on AWS that uses an S3 bucket as an artifact store
and Sagemaker as your orchestrator. The stack will be imported into ZenML once
the deployment is complete and you can start using it right away!

Supported flavors and component types are as follows:

| Component Type | Flavor(s) |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Artifact Store | s3, gcp, minio |
| Container Registry | aws, gcp |
| Experiment Tracker | mlflow |
| Orchestrator | kubernetes, kubeflow, tekton, vertex |
| MLOps Platform | zenml |
| Model Deployer | seldon |
| Step Operator | sagemaker, vertex |

MLStacks currently only supports deployments using AWS, GCP, and K3D as providers.

<summary>Want more details on how this works internally?</summary>

The stack recipe CLI interacts with the
[mlstacks](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlstacks) repository to fetch the recipes
and stores them locally in the **Global Config** directory. 

This is where you could potentially make any changes you want to the recipe files. You can also use native terraform commands like `terraform apply` to deploy components but this would require you to pass the variables manually using the `-var-file` flag to the terraform CLI.

</details>

#### CLI Options for `zenml stack deploy`

Current required options to be passed in to the `zenml stack deploy` subcommand
are:

- `-p` or `--provider`: The cloud provider to deploy the stack on. Currently
  supported providers are `aws`, `gcp`, and `k3d`.
- `-n` or `--name`: The name of the stack to be deployed. This is used to
  identify the stack in ZenML.
- `-r` or `--region`: The region to deploy the stack in.

The remaining options relate to which components you want to deploy.

If you want to pass an `mlstacks` stack specification file into the CLI to use
for deployment, you can do so with the `-f` option. Similarly, if you wish to
see more of the Terraform logging, prompts and output, you can pass the `-d`
flag to turn on `debug-mode`.

Any extra configuration for specific components (as noted in the individual
component deployment documentation) can be passed
in with the `-x` option. This option can be used multiple times to pass in
multiple configurations.

#### Interactive stack deployment

If you would like to be guided through the deployment process, you can use the
`zenml stack deploy` command with the `--interactive` flag. You will still need
to provide the `provider`, `name` and `region` options as described above but
for the rest, you will get prompts in the CLI as to which components you would
like to deploy. For example, using GCP as the provider you might type:

```bash
zenml stack deploy -p gcp -n my_new_stack -r us-east1 --interactive
```

### Displaying Terraform outputs for stacks deployed with mlstacks

If you want to view any of the Terraform-generated outputs for a stack deployed
with `mlstacks`, you can do so with the following command:

```bash
zenml stack describe -o <STACK_NAME>
```

This will print any available outputs to the console if you have deployed a
stack with `mlstacks` via ZenML.

### Deleting / destroying resources

üóëÔ∏è Once you're done running your pipelines, there's only a single command you need to execute that will take care of cleaning up all the resources that you had created on your cloud.

```
zenml stack destroy <STACK_NAME>
```

This will offer you the option to delete the underlying stack specifications and
state files as well. You can also choose to delete the stack from your ZenML
server.

## Deploy a stack component

If you have used ZenML before, you must be familiar with the flow of registering new stack components. It goes something like this:

```shell
zenml artifact-store register my_store --flavor=s3 --path=s3://my_bucket
```

Commands like these assume that you already have the stack component deployed. In this case, it would mean that you must already have a bucket called `my_bucket` on AWS S3 to be able to use this component.

We took inspiration from this design to build something that feels natural to use and is also sufficiently powerful to take care of the deployment of the respective stack components for you. This is where the \<STACK\_COMPONENT> `deploy` CLI comes in!

The `deploy` command allows you to deploy individual components of your MLOps stack with a single command üöÄ. You can also customize your components easily by passing in flags (more on that later).

{% hint style="info" %}
To install `mlstacks`, either run `pip install mlstacks` or `pip install "zenml[mlstacks]"` to install it along with ZenML.

MLStacks uses Terraform on the backend to manage infrastructure. You will need to have Terraform installed. Please visit [the Terraform docs](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli#install-terraform) for installation instructions.

MLStacks also uses Helm to deploy Kubernetes resources. You will need to have Helm installed. Please visit [the Helm docs](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script) for installation instructions.
{% endhint %}

For example, to deploy an artifact store on a GCP account, you can run:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# after installing mlstacks
zenml artifact-store deploy -f gcp -p gcp -r us-east1 -x project_id=zenml my_store
```
{% endcode %}

The command above takes in the following parameters:

* **Name**: The name of the stack component. In this case, it is `my_store`.
* **Flavor:** The flavor of the stack component to deploy. Here, we are deploying an artifact store with the `gcp` flavor.
* **Provider:** The provider to deploy this stack component on. Currently, only **GCP, AWS, and K3D** are supported as providers.
* **Region**: The region to deploy the stack component in.
* **Extra Config:** Some components can be customized by the user and these settings are passed as flags to the command. In the example above, we pass the GCP project ID to select what project to deploy the component to.

Successful execution of this command does the following:

* It also automatically registers the deployed stack component with your ZenML server, so you don't have to worry about manually configuring components after the deployment! ü§©

{% hint style="info" %}
The command currently uses your local credentials for GCP and AWS to provision resources. Integration with your ZenML connectors might be possible soon too!
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Want to know what happens in the background?</summary>

The stack component deploy CLI is powered by ZenML's [mlstacks](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlstacks) in the background. This allows you to configure and deploy select stack components.

Using the values you pass for the cloud, the CLI picks up the right modular recipe to use (one of AWS, GCP, or K3D) and then deploys that recipe with the specific stack component enabled.

</details>

### Destroying a stack component

Destroying a stack component (i.e. deleting and destroying the underlying
infrastructure) is as easy as deploying one. You can run the following command
to destroy the artifact store we created above:

```bash
zenml artifact-store destroy -p gcp my_store
```

This will destroy the deployed infrastructure and prompt you if you also want to remove and deregister the component from your ZenML server.

### üç® Available flavors for stack components

Here's a table of all the flavors that can be deployed through the CLI for every stack component. This is a list that will keep on growing and you can also contribute any flavor or stack component that you feel is missing. Refer to the [Contribution page](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for steps on how to do that :smile:

<details>

<summary>How does flavor selection work in the background?</summary>

Whenever you pass in a flavor to any stack-component deploy function, the combination of these two parameters is used to construct a variable name in the following format:

```
enable_<STACK_COMPONENT>_<FLAVOR>
```

This variable is then passed as input to the underlying modular recipe. If you check the [`variables.tf`](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlstacks/blob/main/gcp-modular/variables.tf) file for a given recipe, you can find all the supported flavor-stack component combinations there.

</details>

| Component Type     | Flavor(s)                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Artifact Store     | s3, gcp, minio                       |
| Container Registry | aws, gcp                             |
| Experiment Tracker | mlflow                               |
| Orchestrator       | kubernetes, kubeflow, tekton, vertex |
| MLOps Platform     | zenml                                |
| Model Deployer     | seldon                               |
| Step Operator      | sagemaker, vertex                    |

#### ‚ú® Customizing your stack components

With simplicity, we didn't want to compromise on the flexibility that this deployment method allows. As such, we have added the option to pass configuration specific to the stack components as key-value arguments to the deploy CLI. Here is an assortment of all possible configurations that can be set.

<details>

<summary>How do configuration flags work?</summary>

The flags that you pass to the deploy CLI are passed on as-is to the backing modular recipes as input variables. This means that all the flags need to be defined as variables in the respective recipe.

For example, if you take a look at the [`variables.tf`](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlstacks/blob/main/gcp-modular/variables.tf) file for a modular recipe, like the `gcp-modular` recipe, you can find variables like `mlflow_bucket` that you could potentially pass in.

Validation for these flags does not exist yet at the CLI level, so you must be careful in naming them while calling `deploy`.

All these extra configuration options are passed in with the `-x` option. For example, we already saw this in action above when we passed in the GCP project ID to the artifact store deploy command.

```bash
zenml artifact-store deploy -f gcp -p gcp -r us-east1 -x project_id=zenml my_store
```

Simply pass in as many `-x` flags as you want to customize your stack component.

</details>

**Experiment Trackers**

You can assign an existing bucket to the MLflow experiment tracker by passing the `-x mlflow_bucket=...` configuration:

```shell
zenml experiment-tracker deploy mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow -p YOUR_DESIRED_PROVIDER -r YOUR_REGION -x mlflow_bucket=gs://my_bucket
```

**Artifact Stores**

For an artifact store, you can pass `bucket_name` as an argument to the command.

```bash
zenml artifact-store deploy s3_artifact_store --flavor=s3 --provider=aws -r YOUR_REGION -x bucket_name=my_bucket
```

**Container Registries**

For container registries, you can pass the repository name using `repo_name`:

```bash
zenml container-registry deploy aws_registry --flavor=aws -p aws -r YOUR_REGION -x repo_name=my_repo
```

This is only useful for the AWS case since AWS requires a repository to be created before pushing images to it and the deploy command ensures that a repository with the name you provide is created. In case of GCP and other providers, you can choose the repository name at the same time as you are pushing the image via code. This is achieved through setting the `target_repo` attribute of [the `DockerSettings` object](../customize-docker-builds/README.md).

#### Other configuration

* In the case of GCP components, it is _required_ that you pass a project ID to the command as extra configuration when you're creating any GCP resource.
