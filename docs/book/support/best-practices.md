# Best Practices


## Pass requirements to pipeline even if using default orchestrator
## Nest `p.run()` in `if __name__ == "__main__"`
## Use `zenml GROUP explain`
## Don't share metadata stores across artifact stores
## Never call the pipeline instance `pipeline` or a step instance `step`
## Recommended Repository Structure
## Use profiles to manage stacks
## Use unique pipeline names across projects, especially if used with the same metadata store
