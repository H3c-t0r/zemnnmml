description: Tracking the execution of your pipelines/steps
---

The configuration of each pipeline, step and produced artifacts are all tracked
within the metadata store. The metadata
store is an SQL database, and can be sqlite or mysql.
ZenML puts a lot of emphasis on guaranteed tracking of inputs across pipeline
steps. The strict, fully automated, and
deeply built-in tracking enables some powerful features - e.g. reproducibility.
