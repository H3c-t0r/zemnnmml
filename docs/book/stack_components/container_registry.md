# Container Registry

A container registry is a store for (Docker) containers. A ZenML workflow
involving a container registry would
automatically containerize your code to be transported across stacks running
remotely. As part of the deployment to the
cluster, the ZenML base image would be downloaded (from a cloud container
registry) and used as the basis for the
deployed 'run'.

For instance, when you are running a local container-based stack, you would
therefore have a local container registry
which stores the container images you create that bundle up your pipeline code.
You could also use a remote container
registry like the Elastic Container Registry at AWS in a more production
setting.
