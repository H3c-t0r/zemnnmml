# Artifact Store

An artifact store is a place where artifacts are stored. These artifacts may have been produced by the pipeline steps,
or they may be the data first ingested into a pipeline via an ingestion step. An artifact store will store all
intermediary pipeline step results, which in turn will be tracked in the metadata store.
