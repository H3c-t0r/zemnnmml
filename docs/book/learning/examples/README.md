ZenML Examples are small-scale production-grade ML use cases powered by ZenML. They are fully fleshed-out, end-to-end, projects that showcase ZenML's capabilities. They can also serve as a template from which to start similar projects.

## Start working on your own projects with ZenML Templates

If you like the projects listed above and you are interested in creating your own project, you can take a look at our [ZenML Project Templates](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-project-templates). The goal of these templates is to help you generate ready-to-use scaffolding for your own projects, with everything you need to get started: steps, pipelines, stack configurations, and other useful resources.
