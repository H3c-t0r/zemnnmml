### ZenBytes: Learn MLOps with ZenML

[ZenBytes](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) is a series of short practical MLOps lessons through ZenML and its various integrations. It is intended for people looking to learn about MLOps generally, and also for ML practitioners who want to get started with ZenML.

After you've run and understood the example above, your next port of call is probably either the [fully-fleshed-out quickstart example](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/quickstart) and then to look at [the ZenBytes repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenbytes) and notebooks.
