# üê£ Starter guide

Whether you are a MLOps Engineer building an internal ML platform or a Data Scientist who is a ZenML-powered MLOps platform, it all starts with learning the basics. The starter guide will walk you through the basics of the ZenML framework.

We will touch on topics like:

- Creating your first ML pipeline
- Understanding caching between pipeline steps
- Managing data and data versioning
- Tracking your machine learning models
- Fetching objects after pipelines have run

We will end with a [starter project](starter-project.md) that will be your first of hopefully many MLOps projects driven by ZenML.

This guide intends not only to be a starting point for ZenML, but also of your entire MLOps journey. So strap in, get your virtualenvs ready, and let's get right into!
