# Deploy a cloud stack

{% hint style="warning" %}
We're still working on finishing this easy-to-consume production guide for you. In the meanwhile, please follow the provided links in this space as an interim guide.
{% endhint %}

This section of the production guide will be about creating your first cloud stack. This means we will be creating the following components in the cloud provider of your choice:

- A [Skypilot Orchestrator](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/orchestrators/skypilot-vm.md).
- An [AWS](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/artifact-stores/s3.md), [GCP](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/artifact-stores/gcp.md), or [Azure](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/artifact-stores/azure.md) artifact store.
- A [container registry](../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/container-registries/container-registries.md)

A simplified [GCP guide](../../stacks-and-components/stack-deployment/cloud-stacks/minimal-gcp-stack.md) is already available. The docs also have a dedicated [Stack deployment](../../stacks-and-components/stack-deployment/) section with a lot more information!

Until this section is ready, please use the above information to configure your cloud stack!
