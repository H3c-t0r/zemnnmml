# Generation evaluation

Now that we have a sense of how to evaluate the retrieval component of our RAG
pipeline, let's move on to the generation component. The generation component is
responsible for generating the answer to the question based on the retrieved
context. At this point, our evaluation starts to move into more subjective
territory. It's harder to come up with metrics that can accurately capture the
quality of the generated answers. However, there are some things we can do.

As with the [retrieval evaluation](retrieval.md), we can start with a simple
approach and then move on to more sophisticated methods.
