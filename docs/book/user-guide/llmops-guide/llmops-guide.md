# ðŸ¦œ LLMOps Guide

Welcome to the ZenML LLMOps Guide, where we dive into the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to integrate them seamlessly into your MLOps pipelines using ZenML. This guide is designed for ML practitioners and MLOps engineers looking to harness the potential of LLMs while maintaining the robustness and scalability of their workflows.

In this guide, we'll explore various aspects of working with LLMs in ZenML, including:

* [RAG with ZenML](rag-with-zenml.md)
  * Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  * Data ingestion and index store management
  * Tracking RAG-associated artifacts with ZenML
* [Finetuning with ZenML](finetuning-with-zenml.md)
  * Setting up finetuning scenarios
  * Integrating finetuning into ZenML pipelines
  * Best practices for data preparation, hyperparameter tuning, and monitoring
* [Deploying and Serving Finetuned Models](deploying-serving-finetuned-models.md)
  * Challenges and solutions for deploying finetuned models with ZenML
  * Model compression and distillation techniques
  * Monitoring and logging deployed models
* [Lifecycle Considerations with Finetuned Models (LLMOps)](lifecycle-considerations-finetuned-models.md)
  * Retraining and updating finetuned models
  * Versioning and tracking model artifacts

To follow along with the examples and tutorials in this guide, ensure you have a Python environment set up with ZenML installed. Familiarity with the concepts covered in the [Starter Guide](../starter-guide/) and [Production Guide](../production-guide/) is recommended.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a solid understanding of how to leverage LLMs in your MLOps workflows using ZenML, enabling you to build powerful, scalable, and maintainable LLM-powered applications. Let's embark on this exciting journey together!
