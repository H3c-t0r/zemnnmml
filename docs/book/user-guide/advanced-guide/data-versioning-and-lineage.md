# Artifacts in ZenML

In this guide, we will learn about how ZenML manages artifacts through materializers, enabling artifact caching, and providing insights into how models are created. We will also discuss how ML engineers can use this to reproduce results, get lineage of artifacts across environments and stacks, and visualize artifacts in the ZenML dashboard.

## Artifact Management with Materializers

ZenML uses materializers to store artifacts in an Artifact Store. Materializers are responsible for serializing and deserializing artifacts, allowing ZenML to save and load artifacts in a consistent manner. When a pipeline runs, ZenML determines whether to use old pipeline runs or create new ones based on the artifacts and their associated materializers.

## Artifact Caching and Lineage

Artifact caching is a powerful feature in ZenML that allows ML engineers to switch out parts of their ML pipelines without having to rerun any previous steps. This is particularly useful when experimenting with different configurations or when working with large datasets, as it can save time and computational resources.

By tracking the lineage of artifacts across environments and stacks, ZenML enables ML engineers to reproduce results and understand the exact steps taken to create a model. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of machine learning models, especially when working in a team or across different environments.

## Visualizing Artifacts

ZenML automatically saves visualizations for many common data types, allowing you to view these visualizations in the ZenML dashboard. This provides an intuitive way to explore and understand the artifacts generated by your ML pipelines, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and potential issues in your data and models.

Visualizations are created using the `save_visualizations()` method of materializers, which can be overridden to customize the visualizations for specific artifact types. These visualizations are then shown next to your artifacts in the dashboard, providing a convenient way to explore and understand the artifacts generated by your ML pipelines.

In addition to the dashboard, you can also view visualizations in Jupyter notebooks using the `visualize()` method of an artifact. This allows you to interactively explore your artifacts and their visualizations within your notebook environment.

By leveraging ZenML's artifact management, caching, lineage tracking, and visualization capabilities, ML engineers can gain valuable insights into their models, streamline their experimentation process, and ensure the reproducibility and reliability of their machine learning workflows.
