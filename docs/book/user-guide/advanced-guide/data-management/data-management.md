# Data management

Data is central to MLOps, and as such deserves a dedicated section in this
documentation. ZenML manages many different types of data for you:

- [Artifacts](../../starter-guide/manage-artifacts.md) that are stored in the [Artifact Store](../../../stacks-and-components/component-guide/artifact-stores/)
- [Models](../../starter-guide/track-ml-models.md) which represent a business use case
for a machine learning problem.
- [Metadata](logging-metadata.md) which is associated with various components of ZenML.

This guide dives deeper into the management of this data.
