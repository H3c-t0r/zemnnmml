# Introduction

Are you an ML engineer or data scientist shipping models to production and jumbling a plethora of tools?
Do you struggle with versioning data, code, and models in your projects?
Have you had trouble replicating production pipelines and monitoring models in production?

If you answered yes to any, **ZenML** is here to help with all that, and more.

**ZenML** is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines. 
It's built for data scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers to collaborate as they develop to production.
**ZenML** has simple, flexible syntax, is **cloud-** and 
**tool-agnostic**, and has interfaces/abstractions that are catered towards ML workflows.


At its core, **ZenML pipelines execute ML-specific workflows** from sourcing
data to splitting, preprocessing, training, all the way to serving and monitoring 
ML models in production. There are many built-in features to support
common ML development tasks. ZenML is not here to replace the great tools that
solve these individual problems. Rather, it offers an **extensible framework** and a
standard abstraction to write and build your workflows.

## Why ZenML

ZenML pipelines are designed to be written early in the development lifecycle. 
As data scientist, you can explore your pipelines as you develop towards production.
Once you're satisfied, you can easily switch from local to cloud deployment with ease.
Read more about why we started building ZenML on our [blog](https://blog.zenml.io/why-zenml/).

Here's what you get by using ZenML -

+ Extensible - Build a framework to suit your specific needs.
+ Reproducibility - Replicate training and inference workflows easily.
+ Clarity - Represent steps of your pipeline in code.
+ Batteries-included integrations - Bring all your favorite tools together.
+ Easily switch between local and cloud stacks.
+ Painless deployment and infrastructure configuration.


## **Pipelining** - Take your first ZenML Steps

Every journey has to start somewhere, if you are new to ZenML, you might want to
get acquainted with the [core concepts](core-concepts.md) first, 
to understand what makes ZenML so special. Afterward, you could jump right 
into our [developer guide](developer-guide/installation.md) that will 
take you from zero to hero in no time and explain the necessary knowledge of 
**how to use ZenML**.

## **Stacking** - Customize your Stack

Already ran your first pipelines and want to know about integrations and
production use cases? Our [Advanced Guides](advanced-guide/integrations.md) are the 
right place for you. You'll find some more detailed descriptions of specific
use cases and features here. This is where you'll learn how to take your 
MLOps stack from basic to fully loaded.

## **Extending** - Make it your own

ZenML does not natively support your favorite tool? Don't you worry! ZenML is 
built from the ground up with extensibility in mind. Find out how to integrate 
other tools or proprietary on-prem solutions for you and your team in our 
section on [Stack Components](advanced-guide/stacks-components-flavors.md). 

## **Collaborating** - Work together with your team

Share not only your code but also your ZenML stacks with your team. Find out how
in our section on [collaboration](collaborate/collaborate-with-zenml.md). 

## **Resources** - Learn ZenML with tutorials, examples, and guides

The ZenML team and community have put together many more resources other than the 
documentation to learn about the framework. Learn more in our section on [resources](resources/index.md).
