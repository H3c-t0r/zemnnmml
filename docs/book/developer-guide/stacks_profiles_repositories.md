# Stacks, Profiles, Repositories

## Stacks

Machine learning in production is not just about designing and training models. It is a fractured space consisting of a wide variety of tasks ranging from experiment tracking to orchestration, from model deployment to monitoring, from drift detection to feature stores and much, much more than that. Even though there are already some seemingly well-established solutions for these tasks, it can become increasingly difficult to establish a running production system in a reliable and modular manner once all these solutions are brought together.

This is a problem which is especially critical when switching from a research setting to a production setting. For instance, due to a lack of standards, the time and resources invested in a small PoC-like project can completely to waste, if the initial system can not be transferred to a production-grade setting.

At **ZenML**, we believe that this is one of the most important and challenging problems in the field of MLOps, and it can be solved with a set of standards and well-structured abstractions. Owing to the nature of MLOps, it is essential that these abstractions not only cover concepts such as pipelines and steps which we covered in the previous sections but also the infrastructure elements that on which the pipelines run.

Taking this into consideration, we will introduce three major concepts that ZenML is based on: **Stacks**, **Stack Components** and **Flavors**.

### Stacks

In ZenML, a **stack** essentially represents a set of configurations for the infrastructure of your MLOps platform.

This is achieved by bringing together different types of **stack components**, that are responsible for specific tasks within your ML workflow. We will look at the base abstraction for the **stack components** in more detail in the next section. However, before we get there, let's first take a look at the list of all the stack component types that you can use within your **stack** in the table below:

| **Type of Stack Component**                        | **Description**                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Orchestrator (required)**](../extending-zenml/orchestrators.md)     | Orchestrating the runs of your pipeline                           |
| [**Artifact Store (required)**](../extending-zenml/artifact-stores.md) | Storage for the artifacts created by your pipelines               |
| [**Metadata Store (required)**](../extending-zenml/metadata-stores.md) | Tracking the execution of your pipelines/steps                    |
| [Container Registry](../extending-zenml/container-registries.md)        | Store for your containers                                         |
| [Secrets Manager](../extending-zenml/secrets-managers.md)              | Centralized location for the storage of your secrets              |
| [Step Operator](../extending-zenml/step-operators.md)                  | Execution of individual steps in specialized runtime environments |
| [Model Deployer](../extending-zenml/model-deployers.md)                | Services/platforms responsible for online model serving           |
| [Feature Store](../extending-zenml/feature-stores.md)                  | Management of your data/features                                  |
| [Experiment Tracker](../extending-zenml/experiment-trackers.md)        | Tracking your ML experiments                                      |
| [Alerter](../extending-zenml/alerters.md)                              | Sending alerts through specified channels                         |

Keep in mind that each pipeline run that you execute with ZenML will require a **stack** and each **stack** will be required to include at least an orchestrator, an artifact store, and a metadata store. The rest of the **stack components** are optional, and you can use them as you see fit.

### Base abstractions

As **stacks** represent the entire configuration of your infrastructure, **stack components** represent the configuration of individual layers within your **stack** which conduct specific self-contained tasks. For instance, each ZenML **stack** features an artifact store which is responsible for storing the artifacts generated by your pipelines, or an orchestrator which is responsible for the execution of the steps within your pipeline.

Speaking from structural standpoint, these **stack components** are built on top of base abstractions and in their core you will find the `StackComponent` class:

```python
from abc import ABC
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import ClassVar
from uuid import UUID, uuid4

from zenml.enums import StackComponentType

class StackComponent(BaseModel, ABC):
    """Abstract class for all components of a ZenML stack."""

    # Instance configuration
    name: str
    uuid: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)

    # Class parameters
    TYPE: ClassVar[StackComponentType]
    FLAVOR: ClassVar[str]

    ...
```

There are a few things to unpack here. Let's talk about Pydantic first. Pydantic is a library for [data validation and settings management](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/). Using their `BaseModel` is helping us to configure and serialize these components while allowing us to add a validation layer to each stack component instance/implementation.

You can already see how that comes into play here within the base `StackComponent` implementation. As you can see, each instance of a `StackComponent` needs to include a `name` and an auto-generated `uuid`. These variables will be tracked when we serialize the stack component object. (You can exclude an instance configuration parameter from the serialization by giving it a name which starts with `_`.)

Moreover, you can use class variables by denoting them with the `ClassVar[..]`, which are also excluded from the serialization. Each `StackComponent` implementation features two important class variables called the `TYPE` and the `FLAVOR`. The `TYPE` is utilized when we set up the base implementation for a specific type of stack component whereas the `FLAVOR` parameter is used to denote different flavors (which we will cover in the next section).

With these considerations, we can take a look at the `BaseArtifactStore` as an example:

```python
from typing import ClassVar, Set

from zenml.enums import StackComponentType
from zenml.stack import StackComponent


class BaseArtifactStore(StackComponent):
    """Abstract class for all ZenML artifact stores."""

    # Instance configuration
    path: str

    # Class parameters
    TYPE: ClassVar[StackComponentType] = StackComponentType.ARTIFACT_STORE
    SUPPORTED_SCHEMES: ClassVar[Set[str]]

    ...
```

As you can see, the `BaseArtifactStore` sets the correct `TYPE`, while introducing a new instance variable called `path` and class variable called `SUPPORTED_SCHEMES`, which will be used by all the subclasses of this base implementation.

### Flavors

Now that we have taken a look at the base abstraction of **stack components**, it is time to introduce the concept of **flavors**. In ZenML, a **flavor** represents an implementation of a specific type of **stack component** on top of its base abstraction. As an example, we can take a look at the `LocalArtifactStore`:

```python
from typing import ClassVar, Set

from zenml.artifact_stores import BaseArtifactStore


class LocalArtifactStore(BaseArtifactStore):
    """Artifact Store for local artifacts."""

    # Class configuration
    FLAVOR: ClassVar[str] = "local"
    SUPPORTED_SCHEMES: ClassVar[Set[str]] = {""}

    ...
```

As you can see from the example above, the `LocalArtifactStore` inherits from the corresponding base abstraction `BaseArtifactStore` and implements a local version. While creating this class, it is critical to set the `FLAVOR` class variable, as we will use it as a reference when we create an instance of this stack component.

Out-of-the-box, ZenML comes with a wide variety of **flavors**. These **flavors** are either built-in to the base ZenML library or enabled through the installation of specific integrations. In order to see all the available flavors for a specific type of stack component, you can use the CLI as:

```shell
zenml artifact-store flavor list
```

Through the base abstractions, ZenML also enables you to create your own flavors for any type of stack component. In order to achieve this, you can use the corresponding base abstraction, create your own implementation, and register it through the CLI:

```python
from typing import ClassVar, Set

from zenml.artifact_stores import BaseArtifactStore


class MyCustomArtifactStore(BaseArtifactStore):
    """Custom artifact store implementation."""

    # Class configuration
    FLAVOR: ClassVar[str] = "custom"
    SUPPORTED_SCHEMES: ClassVar[Set[str]] = {"custom://"}

    ...
```

followed by:

```shell
zenml artifact-store flavor register path.to.MyCustomArtifacStore
```

Once you register your new flavor, you can see it in the CLI with:

```shell
zenml artifact-store flavor list
```

### Stack components

Following the flavors, we can take a look at how we can actually create, use and manage actual **stack components** through the CLI. For this purpose, we can keep using the artifact stores as an example.

First, you can start by listing the artifact store instances. If you are using a fresh repository, you should see the default local artifact store.

```shell
zenml artifact-store list
```

Now, if you want to create a new instance of a stack component with a specific flavor, you can use the `register` command. When using this command, you need to provide a `NAME` for the instance and the required instance configuration parameters as `--param=value`.

```shell
zenml artifact-store register NAME --flavor=local --path=/path/to/your/store
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Our CLI features a wide variety of commands that let you easily manage/use your flavors. If you would like to learn more, please do: "`zenml <stack-component-type> --help`" or visit [our CLI docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/cli/).
{% endhint %}

### Bringing it together

Now that you know how to set up your stack components, let us dive into how you can use these instances to simply generate a stack:

```shell
zenml stack register STACK_NAME -o <name-of-your-orchestrator> \
                                -a <name-of-your-artifact-store> \
                                -m <name-of-your-metadata-store> \
                                ...
```

Keep in mind that any ZenML repository that you created through `zenml init` already comes with an initial active `default` stack, which features a local artifact store, a local metadata store, and a local orchestrator. You can see all of your stacks with the following command:

```shell
zenml stack list
```

As mentioned before, each pipeline run in ZenML requires an **active stack**. In order to set one of your stack as active, you can use:

```shell
zenml stack set <name-of-your-stack>
```

Once your stack is activated, you are ready to run the pipeline with the selected stack.

{% hint style="info" %}
Our CLI features a wide variety of commands that let you easily manage/use your stacks. If you would like to learn more, please do: "`zenml stack --help`" or visit [our CLI docs](https://apidocs.zenml.io/latest/cli/).
{% endhint %}

### Runtime configuration

On top of the configuration through the instance parameters, you can also provide an additional runtime configuration to the stack components for your pipeline run. In order to achieve this, you need to provide these configuration parameters as key-value pairs when you run the pipeline:

```python
pipeline.run(runtime_param_1=3, another_param='luna')
```

The provided parameters will be passed to the `prepare_pipeline_deployment` method of each stack component, and you can use this method as an entrypoint to configure your stack components even further.

## Profiles

ZenML implicitly stores all the information about the configured Stacks, Stack
Components, and Stack Component Flavors in the 
[Global Configuration](../resources/global_config.md) on the filesystem of the
machine where it is installed. The details of how ZenML stores this persistent
data, where it is located, and how it is accessed can be configured via the 
ZenML **Profile**.

### The default Profile

The first time you run any `zenml` CLI command on a machine, a `default` 
Profile is automatically created and set as active. Unless otherwise
configured, this `default` profile will contain all stacks and stack components
that you create on your machine.

```
$ zenml profile list
Creating default profile...
Initializing profile `default`...
Initializing store...
Registered stack component with type 'orchestrator' and name 'default'.
Registered stack component with type 'metadata_store' and name 'default'.
Registered stack component with type 'artifact_store' and name 'default'.
Registered stack with name 'default'.
Created and activated default profile.
Running without an active repository root.
Running with active profile: 'default' (global)
┏━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ ACTIVE │ PROFILE NAME │ STORE TYPE │ URL                     │ ACTIVE STACK ┃
┠────────┼──────────────┼────────────┼─────────────────────────┼──────────────┨
┃   👉   │ default      │ local      │ file:///home/stefan/.c… │ default      ┃
┗━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

### Creating and Changing Profiles

Multiple Profiles can be created on the same machine to simulate the experience
of using several independent ZenML instances completely isolated from each
other. The same or even different users can then manage their projects in the
context of different Profiles on the same machine without having to worry
about overwriting existing configurations.

To create a new profile, run
```
zenml profile create <NEW_PROFILE_NAME>
```

To set an existing profile as active, run
```
zenml profile set <PROFILE_NAME>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The active Profile determines the Stacks and Stack Components that are
available for use by ZenML pipelines. New Stacks and Stack Components
registered via the CLI are only added to the active Profile and are available
only as long as that Profile is active.
{% endhint %}

#### Detailed Example

<details>
<summary>Detailed usage example of multiple profiles</summary>

The following example creates a new Profile named `zenml`, sets it as active,
and then shows how the `default` Profile is unaffected by the operations
performed while the `zenml` Profile is active:

```
$ zenml profile create zenml

┗━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

From the above example, you may have also noticed that _the active Profile_ and
_the active Stack_ are global settings that affect all other user sessions open
on the same machine. It is however possible to set the active Profile and active
Stack individually for each user session or project. Keep reading to learn more.

</details>

## Repositories

ZenML has two main locations where it stores information on the local machine.
These are the [Global Configuration](../resources/global_config.md) and the 
_Repository_. The latter is also referred to as the _.zen folder_.

The ZenML **Repository** related to a pipeline run is the folder that contains 
all the files needed to execute the run, such as the respective Python scripts
and modules where the pipeline is defined, or other associated files.
The repository plays a double role in ZenML:

* It is used by ZenML to identify which files must be copied into Docker images 
in order to execute pipeline steps remotely, e.g., when orchestrating pipelines
with [KubeFlow](../mlops_stacks/orchestrators/kubeflow.md).
* It defines the local active [Profile](#profiles) and active [Stack](#stacks)
that will be used when running pipelines from the repository root or one of its
sub-folders, as shown [below](#setting-local-active-profile-and-stack).

### Registering a Repository

You can register your current working directory as a ZenML
Repository by running:

```bash
zenml init
```

This will create a `.zen` directory, which contains a single
`config.yaml` file that stores the local settings:

```yaml
active_profile_name: default
active_stack_name: default
```

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to use the `zenml init` command to initialize a ZenML
_Repository_ in the same location of your custom Python source tree where you
would normally point PYTHONPATH, especially if your Python code relies on a
hierarchy of modules spread out across multiple sub-folders.

ZenML CLI commands and ZenML code will display a warning if they are not running
in the context of a ZenML _Repository_, e.g.:

```shell
stefan@aspyre2:/tmp$ zenml stack list
Unable to find ZenML repository in your current working directory (/tmp) or any parent directories. If you want to use an existing repository which is in a different location, set the environment variable 'ZENML_REPOSITORY_PATH'. If you want to create a new repository, run zenml init.
Running without an active repository root.
Running with active profile: 'default' (global)
┏━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┯━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ ACTIVE │ STACK NAME │ ARTIFACT_STORE │ METADATA_STORE │ ORCHESTRATOR ┃
┠────────┼────────────┼────────────────┼────────────────┼──────────────┨
┃   👉   │ default    │ default        │ default        │ default      ┃
┗━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┷━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```
{% endhint %}

### Setting Local Active Profile and Stack

One of the most useful features of repositories is that you can configure a
different active profile and stack for each of your projects. This is great if
you want to use ZenML for multiple projects on the same machine. Whenever you
create a new ML project, we recommend you run `zenml init` to create a separate
repository, then create and activate a new profile, and then use it to define
your stacks:

```bash
zenml init
zenml profile create <NEW_PROFILE_NAME>
zenml profile set <NEW_PROFILE_NAME>
zenml stack register ...
zenml stack set ...
```

If you do this, the correct profile and stack will automatically
get activated whenever you change directory into a different project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the Stacks and Stack Components are still stored globally, even when
running from inside a ZenML Repository. It is only the active Profile and active
Stack settings that can be configured locally.
{% endhint %}

#### Detailed Example

<details>
<summary>Detailed usage example of local stacks and profiles</summary>

The following example shows how the active Profile and active Stack can be
configured locally for a project without impacting the global settings:

```

/tmp/zenml$ zenml init

The local active profile was initialized to 'default' and the local active stack
to 'default'. This local configuration will only take effect when you're running
ZenML from the initialized repository root, or from a subdirectory. For more
information on profile and stack configuration, please visit https://docs.zenml.io.

```

### Using the Repository in Python

You can access your repository in Python using the `zenml.repository.Repository`
class:

```python
from zenml.repository import Repository


repo = Repository()
```

This allows you to perform various repository operations directly in Python, 
such as [Inspecting Finished Pipeline Runs](post-execution-workflow.md) or
[Managing Stacks in Python](python-stack-management.md).

### Unregistering a Repository

To unregister a repository, simply delete the `.zen` directory in the
respective location, e.g., via 

```bash
rm -rf .zen
```
