# Advanced Guide

The following pages cover advanced ZenML usage scenarios, which the average
ZenML user does not need to know about. However, if you are developing a very
unique or specialized solution with ZenML or are planning to extend or
contribute to ZenML, then you might find the following sections helpful:

* [Passing custom objects through steps with Materializers](developer-guide/materializer.md)
* [Fetching historic runs with Step Fixtures](developer-guide/fetching-historic-runs.md)
* [Managing external services](developer-guide/manage-external-services.md)
