# ZenML 0.13.2 → 0.20.0

The ZenML 0.20.0 release brings a number of big changes to its architecture and
its features, some of which are not backwards compatible with previous versions.
This guide walks you through these changes and offers instructions on how to
migrate your existing ZenML stacks and pipelines to the new version with minimal
effort and disruption to your existing workloads.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Updating to ZenML 0.20.0 needs to be followed by a migration of your existing
ZenML Stacks and you may also need to make changes to your current ZenML
pipeline code. Please read this guide carefully and follow the migration
instructions to ensure a smooth transition.

If you have updated to ZenML 0.20.0 by mistake or are experiencing issues with
the new version, you can always go back to the previous version by using
`pip install zenml==0.13.2` instead of `pip install zenml` when installing
ZenML manually or in your scripts.
{% endhint %}

High-level overview of the changes:

* [ZenML takes over the Metadata Store](#zenml-takes-over-the-metadata-store-role)
role. All information about your ZenML Stacks, pipelines, and artifacts is now
tracked by ZenML itself directly. If you are currently using remote Metadata
Stores (e.g. deployed in cloud) in your stacks, you will probably need to
replace them with [ZenML cloud deployments](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md).
* the [new ZenML Dashboard](#the-zenml-dashboard-is-now-available) is now
available with all ZenML deployments.
* [ZenML Profiles have been removed](#removal-of-profiles-and-the-local-yaml-database)
in favor of ZenML Projects. You need to
[manually migrate your existing ZenML Profiles](#how-to-migrate-your-profiles)
after the update.
* the [configuration of Stack Components is now decoupled from their implementation](#decoupling-stack-component-configuration-from-implementation).
If you extended ZenML with custom stack component implementations, you may need
to update the way they are registered in ZenML.
* the updated ZenML server provides a new and improved collaborative experience.
When connected to a ZenML server, you can now [share your ZenML Stacks and Stack Components](#shared-zenml-stacks-and-stack-components) with other users. If you were
previously using the ZenML Profiles or the ZenML server to share your ZenML
Stacks, you should switch to the new ZenML server and Dashboard and update your
existing workflows to reflect the new features.

## ZenML takes over the Metadata Store role

ZenML can now run [as a server](../getting-started/core-concepts.md#zenml-server-and-dashboard)
that can be accessed via a REST API and also comes with a visual user interface
(called the ZenML Dashboard). This server can be deployed in arbitrary
environments (local, on-prem, via Docker, on AWS, GCP, Azure etc.) and supports
user management, project scoping, and more.

The release introduces a series of commands to facilitate managing the lifecycle
of the ZenML server and to access the pipeline and pipeline run information:

- `zenml connect / disconnect / down / up / logs / status` can be used to
configure your client to connect to a ZenML server, to start a local ZenML
Dashboard or to deploy a ZenML server to a cloud environment. For more
information on how to use these commands, see [the ZenML deployment documentation](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md).
- `zenml pipeline list / runs / delete` can be used to display information and
about and manage your pipelines and pipeline runs.

In ZenML 0.13.2 and earlier versions, information about pipelines and pipeline
runs used to be stored in a separate stack component called the Metadata Store.
Starting with 0.20.0, the role of the Metadata Store is now taken over by ZenML
itself. This means that the Metadata Store is no longer a separate component in
the ZenML architecture, but rather a part of the ZenML core, located wherever
ZenML is deployed: locally on your machine or running remotely as a server.

All metadata is now stored, tracked, and managed by ZenML itself. The Metadata
Store stack component type and all its implementations have been deprecated and
removed. It is no longer possible to register them or include them in ZenML
stacks. This is a key architectural change in ZenML 0.20.0 that further improves
usability, reproducibility and makes it possible to visualize and manage
all your pipelines and pipeline runs in the new ZenML Dashboard.

The architecture changes for the local case are shown in the diagram below:

![ZenML local metadata before 0.20.0](../assets/migration/local-metadata-pre-0.20.png)
![ZenML local metadata after 0.20.0](../assets/migration/local-metadata-post-0.20.png)


The architecture changes for the remote case are shown in the diagram below:

![ZenML remote metadata before 0.20.0](../assets/migration/remote-metadata-pre-0.20.png)
![ZenML remote metadata after 0.20.0](../assets/migration/remote-metadata-post-0.20.png)


{% hint style="warning" %}
It is currently not possible to migrate the pipeline run information already
stored in the existing Metadata Stores to the new ZenML paradigm. This
unfortunately means that this information is lost when upgrading to ZenML
0.20.0. If it is crucial for you that you retain this information after the
update, please reach out to us on [Slack](https://zenml.io/slack) and let us
know. We're more than happy to work with you to find a solution.
{% endhint %}

If you're already using ZenML, aside from the above limitation, this change will
impact you differently, depending on the flavor of Metadata Stores you have in
your stacks:

* if you're using the default `sqlite` Metadata Store flavor in your stacks,
you don't need to do anything. ZenML will automatically switch to using its
local database instead of your `sqlite` Metadata Stores when you update to
0.20.0 (also see how to [migrate your stacks](#how-to-migrate-your-profiles)).

* if you're using the `kubeflow` Metadata Store flavor _only as a way to connect
to the local Kubeflow Metadata Service_ (i.e. the one installed by the `kubeflow`
Orchestrator in a local k3d Kubernetes cluster), you also don't need to do
anything explicitly. When you [migrate your stacks](#how-to-migrate-your-profiles)
to ZenML 0.20.0, ZenML will automatically switch to using its local database.

* if you're using the `kubeflow` Metadata Store flavor to connect to a remote
Kubeflow Metadata Service such as those provided by a Kubeflow installation
running in AWS, Google or Azure, there is currently no equivalent in ZenML
0.20.0. You'll need to [deploy a ZenML Server](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md)
instance close to where your Kubeflow service is running (e.g. in the same
cloud region).

* if you're using the `mysql` Metadata Store flavor to connect to a remote
MySQL database service (e.g. a managed AWS, GCP or Azure MySQL service), you'll
have to [deploy a ZenML Server](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md)
instance connected to that same database.

* if you deployed a `kubernetes` Metadata Store flavor (i.e. a MySQL database
service deployed in Kubernetes), you can [deploy a ZenML Server](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md)
in the same Kubernetes cluster and connect it to that same database. However,
ZenML will no longer provide the `kubernetes` Metadata Store flavor and you'll
have to manage the Kubernetes MySQL database service deployment yourself going
forward.

{% hint style="info" %}
The ZenML Server inherits the same limitations that the Metadata Store had
prior to ZenML 0.20.0:

* it is not possible to use a local ZenML Server to track pipelines and pipeline
runs that are running remotely in the cloud, unless the ZenML server is
explicitly configured to be reachable from the cloud (e.g. by using a public
IP address or a VPN connection).
* using a remote ZenML Server to track pipelines and pipeline runs that are
running locally is possible, but can have significant performance issues due to
the network latency.

It is therefore recommended that you always use a ZenML deployment that is
located as close as possible to and reachable from where your pipelines and step
operators are running. This will ensure the best possible performance and
usability.
{% endhint %}

## The ZenML Dashboard is now available

The new ZenML Dashboard is now bundled into the ZenML Python package and can be
launched directly from Python. The source code lives in the
[ZenML Dashboard repository](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml-dashboard).

To launch it locally, simply run `zenml up` on your machine and follow the
instructions:

```bash
$ zenml up
Deploying a local ZenML server with name 'local'.
Connecting ZenML to the 'local' local ZenML server (http://127.0.0.1:8237).
Updated the global store configuration.
Connected ZenML to the 'local' local ZenML server (http://127.0.0.1:8237).
The local ZenML dashboard is available at 'http://127.0.0.1:8237'. You can
connect to it using the 'default' username and an empty password.
```

The Dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:8237` by
default:

![ZenML Dashboard Preview](../assets/migration/zenml-dashboard.png)

For more details on other possible deployment options, see the
[ZenML deployment documentation](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md).

## Removal of Profiles and the local YAML database

Prior to 0.20.0, ZenML used used a set of local YAML files to store information
about the Stacks and Stack Components that were registered on your machine. In
addition to that, these Stacks could be grouped together and organized under
individual Profiles.

Profiles and the local YAML database have both been deprecated and removed in
ZenML 0.20.0. Stack, Stack Components as well as all other information that
ZenML tracks, such as Pipelines and Pipeline Runs, are now stored in a single
SQL database. These entities are no longer organized into Profiles, but they can
be scoped into different Projects instead.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since the local YAML database is no longer used by ZenML 0.20.0, you will lose
all the Stacks and Stack Components that you currently have configured when you
update to ZenML 0.20.0. If you still want to use these Stacks, you will need to
[manually migrate](#how-to-migrate-your-profiles) them after the update.
{% endhint %}

### 👣How to migrate your Profiles

If you're already using ZenML, you can migrate your existing Profiles to the new
ZenML 0.20.0 paradigm by following these steps:

1. first, update ZenML to 0.20.0. This will automatically invalidate all your
existing Profiles.

2. decide the ZenML deployment model that you want to follow for your projects.
See the [ZenML deployment documentation](../getting-started/deploying-zenml/deploying-zenml.md)
for available deployment scenarios. If you decide on using a local or remote
ZenML server to manage your pipelines, make sure that you first connect your
client to it by running `zenml connect`.

3. use the `zenml profile list` and `zenml profile migrate` CLI commands to
import the Stacks and Stack Components from your Profiles into your new
ZenML deployment. If you have multiple Profiles that you would like to migrate,
you can either use a prefix for the names of your imported Stacks and Stack
Components, or you can use a different ZenML Project for each Profile.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The ZenML Dashboard is currently limited to showing only information that is
available in the `default` Project. If you wish to migrate your Profiles to a
different Project, you will not be able to visualize the migrated Stacks and
Stack Components in the Dashboard. This will be fixed in a future release.
{% endhint %}

Once you've migrated all your Profiles, you can delete the old YAML files.

Example of migrating a `default` profile into the `default` project:

```bash
$ zenml profile list
ZenML profiles have been deprecated and removed in this version of ZenML. All
stacks, stack components, flavors etc. are now stored and managed globally,
either in a local database or on a remote ZenML server (see the `zenml up` and
`zenml connect` commands). As an alternative to profiles, you can use projects
as a scoping mechanism for stacks, stack components and other ZenML objects.

The information stored in legacy profiles is not automatically migrated. You can
do so manually by using the `zenml profile list` and `zenml profile migrate` commands.

The `zenml profile migrate` CLI command also provides command line flags for
cases in which the user wants to overwrite existing components or stacks, or
ignore errors.

## Decoupling Stack Component configuration from implementation

Stack components can now be registered without having the required integrations
installed. As part of this change, we split all existing stack component
definitions into three classes: an implementation class that defines the logic
of the stack component, a config class that defines the attributes and performs
input validations, and a flavor class that links implementation and config
classes together. See **[component flavor models #895](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/pull/895)**
for more details.

If you are only using stack component flavors that are shipped with the zenml
Python distribution, this change has no impact on the configuration of your
existing stacks. However, if you are currently using custom stack component
implementations, you will need to update them to the new format. See the
[documentation on writing custom stack component flavors](../advanced-guide/stacks/custom-flavors.md)
for updated information on how to do this.

## Shared ZenML Stacks and Stack Components

With collaboration being the key part of ZenML, the 0.20.0 release puts the
concepts of Users and Projects front and center and introduces
the possibility to share stacks and stack components with other users by
means of the ZenML server.

When your client is connected to a ZenML server, entities such as Stacks, Stack
Components, Stack Component Flavors, Pipelines, Pipeline Runs, and Artifacts are
scoped to a Project and owned by the User that creates them. Only the objects
that are owned by the current user used to authenticate to the ZenML server and
that are part of the current project are available to the client.

Stacks and Stack Components can also be shared within the same project with
other users. To share an object, either set it as shared during creation time
(e.g. `zenml stack register mystack ... --share`) or afterwards (e.g. through
`zenml stack share mystack`).

To differentiate between shared and private Stacks and Stack Components, these
can now be addressed by name, id or the first few letters of the id in the cli.
E.g. for a stack `default` with id `179ebd25-4c5b-480f-a47c-d4f04e0b6185` you
can now run `zenml stack describe default` or `zenml stack describe 179` or
`zenml stack describe 179ebd25-4c5b-480f-a47c-d4f04e0b6185`.

We also introduce the notion of `local` vs `non-local` stack components. Local
stack components are stack components that are configured to run locally while
non-local stack components are configured to run remotely or in a cloud
environment. Consequently:

* stacks made up of local stack components should not be shared on a central
ZenML Server, even though this is not enforced by the system.
* stacks made up of non-local stack components are only functional if they
are shared through a remotely deployed ZenML Server.

## Other changes

The `Repository` object has been renamed to `Client` to better capture its
functionality. You can continue to use the `Repository` object for backwards
compatibility, but it will be removed in a future release.

Alongside the architectural shift, Pipeline configuration has been completely
rethought. ZenML pipelines and steps could previously be configured in many
different ways:

- On the `@pipeline` and `@step` decorators
- In the `__init__` method of the pipeline and step class
- Using `@enable_xxx` decorators
- Using specialized methods like `pipeline.with_config(...)` or
`step.with_return_materializer(...)`

Some of the configuration options were quite hidden, difficult to access and not
tracked in any way by the ZenML metadata store. The new changes introduced are:

- Pipelines and steps now allow all configurations on their decorators as well
as the `.configure(...)` method. This includes configurations for stack
components that are not infrastructure-related which was previously done using
the `@enable_xxx` decorators)
- The same configurations can also be defined in a yaml file
- The users can think of configuring stacks and pipeline in terms of `Params`
and `Settings`
- `BaseStepConfig` is now renamed to `BaseParameters`
- `DockerConfiguration` is now renamed to `DockerSettings`

All the aforementioned configurations as well as additional information required
to run a ZenML pipelines are now combined into an intermediate representation.
Instead of the user-facing `BaseStep` and `BasePipeline` classes, all the ZenML
orchestrators and step operators now use this intermediate representation to run
pipelines and steps.

The Post-execution workflow has changed as follows:
- @Alexej Penner or @Baris Can Durak can you help me here?
- The `get_pipeline` and `get_run` methods have been moved out of the `Repository` (i.e. the new `Client` ) class and lie directly in the post_execution module now. To use the user has to do:

```bash
from zenml.post_execution import get_pipeline, get_run
```
    
Once a pipeline has been executed, it is represented by a `PipelineSpec` that
uniques identifies it. Therefore, users are no longer able to edit a pipeline
once it has been run once. There are now three options to get around this:

- Pipeline runs can be created without being associated with a pipeline
explicitly: We call these `unlisted` runs
- Pipelines can be deleted and created again
- Pipelines can be given unique names each time they are run to uniquely
identify them

There are multiple changes to the configuration of various stack components and
integratinos:
- enable_whylogs deprecated
- enable_mlflow deprecated
- enable_wandb deprecated

# 🐞 Reporting Bugs

We should come up with a mechanism to report bugs. Suggestions:

- Open up a Slack Channel
- Open up a GitHub issue in ZenML and ZenML dashboard repositories

# 📡Future Changes

While this rehaul is big and will break previous releases, we do have some more work left to do. We expect this to be the last big rehaul of ZenML before our 1.0.0 release, but no other release will be so hard breaking as this one. Currently planned future breaking changes are:

- Following the metadata store, the secret manager stack component will move out of the stack.
- ZenML `StepContext` might be deprecated

# 💾 The New Way (CLI Command Cheat Sheet)

**deploy the server**

`zenml deploy --aws` (maybe don’t do this :) since it spins up infrastructure on AWS…)

**spin up a local zenserver**

`zenml up`

**connect to a pre-existing server**

`zenml connect` (pass in URL / etc, or zenml connect --config + yaml file)

**List your deployed server details**

`zenml status`
