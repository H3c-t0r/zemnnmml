# ⭐ Introduction

🤹 Are you an ML engineer or data scientist shipping models to production while juggling a plethora of tools?

🤷‍♂️ Do you struggle with versioning data, code, and models in your projects?

👀 Have you had trouble replicating production pipelines and monitoring models in production?

[🙇](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#emoji-modal) Are you dealing with lots of unstructured notebooks or scripts with lots of manual processes?

[🚧](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#emoji-modal) Do you find it challenging to transition your ML workflows from the experimentation setting to a production-ready environment?

If you answered yes to any of the questions above, ZenML is here to help you:

* **ZenML** is an **open-source MLOps framework** built for data scientists, ML Engineers, and MLOps Developers.
* It comes equipped with a simple and flexible **Python SDK** that helps you to create **portable and production-ready pipelines**.
* It also features **cloud-** and **tool-agnostic** **interfaces/abstractions** such as orchestration systems, artifact repositories, and model deployment platforms that cover the entire ML journey.
* With these abstractions, it remains **extensible** and **open to customization**. That is also backed by numerous **collaborative features** that allow you to work not just with your team but also with the community.
* Moreover, this creates a separation between the different aspects of ML workflows, allowing users to focus on creating their own respective solutions in an efficient manner.
* Overall, it reduces the complexity of your development lifecycle, all the way **from an experimentation environment to a production-grade solution**.
