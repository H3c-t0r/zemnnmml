description: Deploying ZenML to Huggingface Spaces
---

A quick way to deploy ZenML and get started is to use [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
HuggingFace Spaces is a platform for hosting and sharing ML projects and
workflows, and it also works to deploy ZenML. You can be up and running in
minutes (for free) with a hosted ZenML server so it's a good option if you want
to try out ZenML without any infrastructure overhead.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that it is not recommended to use HuggingFace Spaces for production use as
by default the data stored there is non-persistent and the underlying machine is
not as available to you as a dedicated machine. See our [other deployment options](./deploying-zenml.md)
if you want to use ZenML in production.
