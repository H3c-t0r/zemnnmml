# Why ZenML?

## What is so special about ZenML?

While there are other workflow orchestration tools, ZenML is built because we wanted the following:

* We wanted a tool that is **flexible**: Simple Python functions can be converted into a workflow step.
* We wanted a tool that is **simple:** You can run it locally and with a few commands can get it running on the 
cloud with minimum changes.
* We wanted to created a **machine learning specific** workflow tool: With ML, workflows need to focus not just 
on tasks, but also data like models, parameters, statistics and other ML-specific artifacts. This way we can solve 
machine learning specific problems and create a more understandable API.
* We wanted a tool that can **integrate** with the exploding ML/MLOps landscape: It is so confusing right now because 
every team that is doing serious ML has their own way of doing things. This is completely fine, but we built ZenML to 
be a connector and gateway to many other amazing tools for specific problems in machine learning.

In addition, ZenML uses the following modern concepts in pipeline design to bring the latest best practices to MLOps:

## Pipelines As Experiments

We built ZenML because we could not find an easy framework that translates the patterns observed in the research phase 
with Jupyter notebooks into a production-ready ML environment. ZenML follows the paradigm of Pipelines as Experiments, 
meaning ZenML pipelines are designed to be written early on the development lifecycle, where the users can explore 
their pipelines as they develop towards production.

## Developer Experience

Modern developer experience is an underrated aspect of a ZenML is built to give developers a similar experience as 
other awesome frameworks in other domains like [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co) and 
[PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai), but geared towards MLOps.

## Data-centric Pipelines

Going from model-centric to data-centric AI has been a theme of the last years, popularized by Andrew Ng 
(see video below). ZenML is built with data-centric pipelines in mind. Concretely, this means:

* It allows defining data flow pipelines, rather than task dependencies. (Read this 
[awesome post](https://rillabs.org/posts/workflows-dataflow-not-task-deps) by RIL Labs to see why that matters.)
* It allows developers to explore data artifacts natively in interactive environments.
* It exposes first class data comparison mechanisms and tracks relevant metadata automatically.

## The Right Abstractions

While there are other pipelining solutions for machine learning experiments, **ZenML** is focused on the following:

* Simplicity.
* Reproducibility.
* Integrations.

We wanted to focus on abstractions that can address different needs throughout the lifecycle of the ML process.

## The Modular MLOps Stack: Integrations

It is important that we integrate within the various tools of the fragmented MLOps landscape. ZenML is fully 
extensible, so you are free to build in whatever custom tooling you currently use. We already integrate with a number 
of the most commonly used parts an ML stack: checkout our supported integrations [here](../stack_components/integrations.md).
