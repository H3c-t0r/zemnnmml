# Orchestrator

An orchestrator manages the running of each step of the pipeline, administering the actual pipeline runs. The
orchestrator is especially important, as it defines where the actual pipeline job runs. Think of it as the root of any
pipeline job, that controls how and where each individual step within a pipeline is executed. Therefore, the
orchestrator can be used to great effect to scale jobs in production.
