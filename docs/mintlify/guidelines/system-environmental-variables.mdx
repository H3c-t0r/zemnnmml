description: "How to control ZenML behavior with environmental variables"
---

There are a few pre-defined environmental variables that can be used to control the behavior of ZenML. See the list below with default values and options:

Choose from `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `DEBUG`:

```
ZENML_LOGGING_VERBOSITY=INFO
```

Explicit path to the ZenML repository:

```
ZENML_REPOSITORY_PATH
```

Setting to `false` disables analytics:

```
ZENML_ANALYTICS_OPT_IN=true
```

Setting to `true` switches to developer mode:

```
ZENML_DEBUG=false
```

Setting the `ZENML_ACTIVE_STACK_ID` to a specific UUID will make the corresponding stack the active stack:

```
ZENML_ACTIVE_STACK_ID=
```

When `true`, this prevents a pipeline from executing:

```
ZENML_PREVENT_PIPELINE_EXECUTION=false
```

Set to `false` to disable the [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) traceback:

```
ZENML_ENABLE_RICH_TRACEBACK=true
```

Path to global ZenML config:

```
ZENML_CONFIG_PATH
```

Setting to `false` disables integrations logs suppression:

```
ZENML_SUPPRESS_LOGS=false
```
