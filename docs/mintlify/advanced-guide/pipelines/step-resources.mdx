Some steps of your machine learning pipeline might be more resource-intensive and require special hardware to execute. In such cases, you can specify the required resources for steps as follows:

Functional API

Class-based API

```
from zenml.steps import step, ResourceSettings

@step(settings={"resources": ResourceSettings(cpu_count=8, gpu_count=2)})
def training_step(...) -> ...:
    # train a model
```

```
from zenml.steps import BaseStep, ResourceSettings

class TrainingStep(BaseStep):
    ...

step = TrainingStep(settings = {"resources": ResourceSettings(cpu_count=8, gpu_count=2)})
```

If you're using an orchestrator which does not support this feature or its underlying infrastructure doesn't cover your requirements, you can also take a look at [step operators](/component-gallery/step-operators) which allow you to execute individual steps of your pipeline in environments independent of your orchestrator.
