title: "In-depth Configuration"
description: "Configure pipelines at will with ZenML."
---

The goal of this section is to showcase some critical advanced use-cases regarding the configuration of different ZenML resources.

### List of topics

* [Runtime Settings](/advanced-guide/pipelines/settings) showcases how to configure different ZenML resource during the runtime of a pipeline.

* [Passing Custom Data Types through Steps](/advanced-guide/pipelines/materializers) via **Materializers** is required if one of your steps outputs a custom class or other data types, for which materialization is not defined by ZenML itself.

* [Specifying Hardware Resources for Steps](/advanced-guide/pipelines/step-resources) explains how to specify hardware resources like memory or the amount of CPUs and GPUs that a step requires to execute.

* [Access metadata within steps](/advanced-guide/pipelines/step-metadata) via **Step Fixtures** can, for instance, be used to load the best performing prior model to compare newly trained models against.

* [Controlling the Step Execution Order](/advanced-guide/pipelines/step-order) explains how to control the order in which steps of a pipeline get executed.

We will keep adding more use-cases to the advanced guide of ZenML. If there is a particular topic you cannot find here or any use-case that you would like learn more about, you can reach us in our [Slack Channel](https://zenml.io/slack-invite).
