## Connecting to deployed ZenML

Once ZenML is deployed, one or multiple users can connect to with the `zenml connect` command. If no arguments are supplied, ZenML will attempt to connect to the last ZenML server deployed from the local host using the `zenml deploy` command:

### ZenML Connect: Various options

```sh
zenml connect
```

To connect to a ZenML server, you can either pass the configuration as command line arguments or as a YAML file:

```sh
zenml connect --url=https://zenml.example.com:8080 --username=admin --no-verify-ssl
```

or

```sh
zenml connect --config=/path/to/zenml_server_config.yaml
```

The YAML file should have the following structure when connecting to a ZenML server:

```yaml
url: <The URL of the ZenML server>
username: <The username to use for authentication>
password: <The password to use for authentication>
verify_ssl: |
  <Either a boolean, in which case it controls whether the
  server's TLS certificate is verified, or a string, in which case it
  must be a path to a CA certificate bundle to use or the CA bundle
  value itself>
```

Example of a ZenML server YAML configuration file:

```yaml
url: https://ac8ef63af203226194a7725ee71d85a-7635928635.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/zenml
username: admin
password: Pa$$word123
verify_ssl: |

```

Both options can be combined, in which case the command line arguments will override the values in the YAML file. For example, it is possible and recommended that you supply the password only as a command line argument:

```sh
zenml connect --username zenml --password=Pa@#$#word --config=/path/to/zenml_server_config.yaml
```

To disconnect from the current ZenML server and revert to using the local default database, use the following command:

```sh
zenml disconnect
```
