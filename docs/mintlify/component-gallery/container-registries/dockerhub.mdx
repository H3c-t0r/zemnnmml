The DockerHub container registry is a [container registry](/component-gallery/container-registries) flavor which comes built-in with ZenML and uses [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) to store container images.

### When to use it

You should use the DockerHub container registry if:

* one or more components of your stack need to pull or push container images.

* you have a DockerHub account. If you're not using DockerHub, take a look at the other [container registry flavors](/component-gallery/container-registries#container-registry-flavors).

### How to deploy it

To use the DockerHub container registry, all you need to do is create a [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

When this container registry is used in a ZenML stack, the Docker images that are built will be published in a **public** repository and everyone will be able to pull your images. If you want to use a **private** repository instead, you'll have to [create a private repository](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#creating-repositories) on the website before running the pipeline. The repository name depends on the remote [orchestrator](/component-gallery/orchestrators) or [step operator](/component-gallery/step-operators) that you're using in your stack.

### How to find the registry URI

The DockerHub container registry URI should have one of the two following formats:

```

# or
docker.io/

# Examples:
zenml
my-username
docker.io/zenml
docker.io/my-username
```

To figure our the URI for your registry:

* Find out the account name of your [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) account.

* Use the account name to fill the template `docker.io/<ACCOUNT_NAME>` and get your URI.

### How to use it

To use the Azure container registry, we need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.

* The registry URI. Check out the [previous section](/component-gallery/container-registries/dockerhub#how-to-find-the-registry-uri) on the URI format and how to get the URI for your registry.

We can then register the container registry and use it in our active stack:

```
zenml container-registry register  \
    --flavor=dockerhub \
    --uri=

# Add the container registry to the active stack
zenml stack update -c 
```

Additionally, we'll need to log in to the container registry so Docker can pull and push images. This will require your DockerHub account name and either your password or preferably a [personal access token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/).

```
docker login
```
