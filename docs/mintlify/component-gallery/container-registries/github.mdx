The GitHub container registry is a [container registry](/component-gallery/container-registries) flavor which comes built-in with ZenML and uses the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) to store container images.

### When to use it

You should use the GitHub container registry if:

* one or more components of your stack need to pull or push container images.

* you're using GitHub for your projects. If you're not using GitHub, take a look at the other [container registry flavors](/component-gallery/container-registries#container-registry-flavors).

### How to deploy it

The GitHub container registry is enabled by default when you create a GitHub account.

### How to find the registry URI

The GitHub container registry URI should have the following format:

```
ghcr.io/

# Examples:
ghcr.io/zenml
ghcr.io/my-username
ghcr.io/my-organization
```

To figure our the URI for your registry:

* Use the GitHub user or organization name to fill the template `ghcr.io/<USER_OR_ORGANIZATION_NAME>` and get your URI.

### How to use it

To use the GitHub container registry, we need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.

* The registry URI. Check out the [previous section](/component-gallery/container-registries/github#how-to-find-the-registry-uri) on the URI format and how to get the URI for your registry.

* Our Docker client configured, so it can pull and push images. Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry) to create a personal access token and login to the container registry.

We can then register the container registry and use it in our active stack:

```
zenml container-registry register  \
    --flavor=github \
    --uri=

# Add the container registry to the active stack
zenml stack update -c 
```
