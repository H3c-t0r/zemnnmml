The Azure secrets manager is a [secrets manager](/component-gallery/secrets-managers) flavor provided with the ZenML `azure` integration that uses [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/#product-overview) to store secrets.

### When to use it

You should use the Azure secrets manager if:

* a component of your stack requires a secret for authentication, or you want to use secrets inside your steps.

* you're already using Azure, especially if your orchestrator is running in Azure. If you're using a different cloud provider, take a look at the other [secrets manager flavors](/component-gallery/secrets-managers#secrets-manager-flavors).

### How to deploy it

* Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home).

* In the search bar, enter `key vaults` and open up the corresponding service.

* Click on `+ Create` in the top left.

* Fill in all values and create the key vault.

### How to use it

To use the Azure secrets manager, we need:

* The ZenML `azure` integration installed. If you haven't done so, run  
```  
zenml integration install azure  
```

* The [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed and authenticated.

* The name of the key vault to use. You can find a list of your key vaults by going to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) and searching for `key vaults`. If you don't have any key vault yet, follow the

* [deployment guide](/component-gallery/secrets-managers/azure#how-to-deploy-it) to create one.

We can then register the secrets manager and use it in our active stack:

```
zenml secrets-manager register  \
    --flavor=azure \
    --key_vault_name=

# Add the secrets manager to the active stack
zenml stack update -x 
```

You can now [register, update or delete secrets](/component-gallery/secrets-managers#in-the-cli) using the CLI or [fetch secret values inside your steps](/component-gallery/secrets-managers#in-a-zenml-step).

You can use [secret scoping](/component-gallery/secrets-managers#secret-scopes) with the Azure Secrets Manager to emulate multiple Secrets Manager namespaces on top of a single Azure key vault.

A concrete example of using the Azure secrets manager can be found [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/cloud%5Fsecrets%5Fmanager).
