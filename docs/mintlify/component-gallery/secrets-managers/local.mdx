The local secrets manager is a [secrets manager](/component-gallery/secrets-managers) flavor which comes built-in with ZenML and uses the local filesystem to store secrets.

### When to use it

The local secrets manager is built for early local development and should not be used it a production setting. It stores your secrets without encryption and only works in combination with the [local orchestrator](/component-gallery/orchestrators/local).

### How to deploy it

The local secrets manager comes with ZenML and works without any additional setup.

### How to use it

To use the local secrets manager, we can register it and use it in our active stack:

```
zenml secrets-manager register  --flavor=local 

# Add the secrets manager to the active stack
zenml stack update -x 
```

You can now [register, update or delete secrets](/component-gallery/secrets-managers#in-the-cli) using the CLI or [fetch secret values inside your steps](/component-gallery/secrets-managers#in-a-zenml-step).
