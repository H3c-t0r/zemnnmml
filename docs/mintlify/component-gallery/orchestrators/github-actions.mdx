The GitHub Actions orchestrator is an [orchestrator](/component-gallery/orchestrators) flavor provided with the ZenML `github` integration that uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run your pipelines.

### When to use it

You should use the GitHub Actions orchestrator if:

* you're using GitHub for your projects.

* you're looking for a free, managed solution to run your pipelines.

* you're looking for a UI in which you can track your pipeline runs.

* your pipeline steps don't require many resources to run. The GitHub Actions orchestrator uses GitHub Actions runners to run your pipelines. These runners have access to limited hardware resources and are not able to run computationally intensive tasks.

### How to deploy it

The GitHub Actions orchestrator runs on hardware provided by GitHub Actions runners and only requires you to have a GitHub account and repository.

### How to use it

To use the GitHub Actions orchestrator, we need:

* The ZenML `github` integration installed. If you haven't done so, run  
```  
zenml integration install github  
```

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.

* A [remote artifact store](/component-gallery/artifact-stores) as part of your stack.

* A [GitHub container registry](/component-gallery/container-registries/github) as part of your stack.

We can then register the orchestrator and use it in our active stack:

```
zenml orchestrator register  --flavor=github

# Register and activate a stack with the new orchestrator
zenml stack register  -o  ... --set
```

ZenML will build a Docker image called `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>/zenml:<PIPELINE_NAME>` which includes your code and use it to run your pipeline steps in GitHub. Check out [this page](/advanced-guide/pipelines/containerization) if you want to learn more about how ZenML builds these images and how you can customize them.

You can now run any ZenML pipeline using the GitHub Actions orchestrator:

```
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py
```

In contrast with our other orchestrators, this does not automatically run your pipeline. Your pipeline will only work once you push the workflow file that the orchestrator has written in the previous `python` call. If you want to automate this process and want the orchestrator to commit and run these files automatically, you can set the orchestrators `push` attribute to `True`. To do so, simply update your orchestrator:

```
zenml orchestrator update  --push=True
```

A concrete example of using the GitHub Actions orchestrator can be found [here](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/tree/main/examples/github%5Factions%5Forchestration).
