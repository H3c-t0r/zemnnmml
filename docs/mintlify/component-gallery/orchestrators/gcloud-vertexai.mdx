---

The Vertex orchestrator is an [orchestrator](/component-gallery/orchestrators) flavor provided with the ZenML `gcp` integration that uses [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) to run your pipelines.

This component is only meant to be used within the context of [remote ZenML deployment scenario](/getting-started/deploying-zenml). Usage with a local ZenML deployment may lead to unexpected behavior!

### When to use it

You should use the Vertex orchestrator if:

* you're already using GCP.

* you're looking for a proven production-grade orchestrator.

* you're looking for a UI in which you can track your pipeline runs.

* you're looking for a managed solution for running your pipelines.

* you're looking for a serverless solution for running your pipelines.

### How to deploy it

In order to use a Vertex AI orchestrator, you need to first deploy [ZenML to the cloud](/getting-started/deploying-zenml). It would be recommended to deploy ZenML in the same Google Cloud project as where the Vertex infrastructure is deployed, but it is not necessary to do so. You must ensure that you are [connected to the remote ZenML server](/starter-guide/collaborate/zenml-deployment) before using this stack component.

The only other thing necessary to use the ZenML Vertex orchestrator is enabling Vertex relevant APIs on the Google Cloud project.

In order to quickly enable APIs, and create other resources necessary for to use this integration, you can also consider using the [Vertex AI stack recipe](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks/tree/main/vertex-ai), which helps you set up the infrastructure with one click.

### How to use it

To use the Vertex orchestrator, we need:

* The ZenML `gcp` integration installed. If you haven't done so, run  
```  
zenml integration install gcp  
```

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.

* A [remote artifact store](/component-gallery/artifact-stores) as part of your stack.

* A [remote container registry](/component-gallery/container-registries) as part of your stack.

* The GCP project ID and location in which you want to run your Vertex AI pipelines.

* The pipeline client environment needs permissions to create a job in Vertex Pipelines, e.g. the `Vertex AI User` role: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.user

* To run on a schedule, the client environment also needs permissions to create a Google Cloud Function (e.g. with the [cloudfunctions.serviceAgent Role](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/iam)) and to create a Google Cloud Scheduler (e.g. with the [Cloud Scheduler Job Runner Role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)). Additionally, it needs the [Storage Object Creator Role](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) to be able to write the pipeline JSON file to the artifact store directly.

We can then register the orchestrator and use it in our active stack:

```
zenml orchestrator register  \
    --flavor=vertex \
    --project= \
    --location=

# Register and activate a stack with the new orchestrator
zenml stack register  -o  ... --set
```

ZenML will build a Docker image called `<CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI>/zenml:<PIPELINE_NAME>` which includes your code and use it to run your pipeline steps in Vertex AI. Check out [this page](/advanced-guide/pipelines/containerization) if you want to learn more about how ZenML builds these images and how you can customize them.

You can now run any ZenML pipeline using the Vertex orchestrator:

```
python file_that_runs_a_zenml_pipeline.py
```

#### Run pipelines on a schedule

The Vertex Pipelines orchestrator supports running pipelines on a schedule, using logic resembling the [official approach recommended by GCP](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/pipelines/schedule-cloud-scheduler).

ZenML utilizes the [Cloud Scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler) and [Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) services to enable scheduling on Vertex Pipelines. The following is the sequence of events that happen when running a pipeline on Vertex with a schedule:

* Docker image is created and pushed (see above [containerization](/advanced-guide/pipelines/containerization)).

* The Vertex AI pipeline JSON file is copied to the [Artifact Store](/component-gallery/artifact-stores) specified in your [Stack](/starter-guide/stacks)

* Cloud Function is created that creates the Vertex Pipeline job when triggered.

* Cloud Scheduler job is created that triggers the Cloud Function on the defined schedule.

Therefore, to run on a schedule, the client environment needs permissions to create a Google Cloud Function (e.g. with the [cloudfunctions.serviceAgent Role](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/iam)) and to create a Google Cloud Scheduler (e.g. with the [Cloud Scheduler Job Runner Role](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)). Additionally, it needs the [Storage Object Creator Role](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) to be able to write the pipeline JSON file to the artifact store directly.

Once your have these permissions set in your local GCP CLI, here is how to create a scheduled Vertex pipeline in ZenML:

```
from zenml.config.schedule import Schedule

# Run a pipeline every 5th minute
pipeline_instance.run(
    schedule=Schedule(
        cron_expression="*/5 * * * *"
    )
)
```

The Vertex orchestrator only supports the `cron_expression` parameter in the `Schedule` object, and will ignore all other parameters supplied to define the schedule.

**How to delete a scheduled pipeline**

Note that ZenML only gets involved to schedule a run, but maintaining the lifecycle of the schedule is the responsibility of the user.

In order to cancel a scheduled Vertex pipeline, you need to manually delete the generated Google Cloud Function, along with the Cloud Scheduler job that schedules it (via the UI or the CLI).

#### Additional configuration

For additional configuration of the Vertex orchestrator, you can pass `VertexOrchestratorSettings` which allows you to configure (among others) the following attributes:

* `pod_settings`: Node selectors, affinity and tolerations to apply to the Kubernetes Pods running your pipline. These can be either specified using the Kubernetes model objects or as dictionaries.

```
from zenml.integrations.gcp.flavors.vertex_orchestrator_flavor import VertexOrchestratorSettings
from kubernetes.client.models import V1Toleration

vertex_settings = VertexOrchestratorSettings(
    pod_settings={
        "affinity": {
            "nodeAffinity": {
                "requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution": {
                    "nodeSelectorTerms": [
                        {
                            "matchExpressions": [
                                {
                                    "key": "node.kubernetes.io/name",
                                    "operator": "In",
                                    "values": ["my_powerful_node_group"],
                                }
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        "tolerations": [
            V1Toleration(
                key="node.kubernetes.io/name",
                operator="Equal",
                value="",
                effect="NoSchedule"
            )
        ]
    }
)

@pipeline(
    settings={
        "orchestrator.vertex": vertex_settings
    }
)
  ...
```

#### Enabling CUDA for GPU-backed hardware

Note that if you wish to use this orchestrator to run steps on a GPU, you will need to follow [the instructions on this page](/advanced-guide/pipelines/gpu-hardware) to ensure that it works. It requires adding some extra settings customization and is essential to enable CUDA for the GPU to give its full acceleration.
