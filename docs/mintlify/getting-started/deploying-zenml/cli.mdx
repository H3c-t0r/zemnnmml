description: "Deploying ZenML on cloud using the CLI"
---

The easiest and fastest way to get running on the cloud is by using the `deploy` CLI command. It currently only supports deploying to Kubernetes on managed cloud services. You can check the [overview page](/getting-started/deploying-zenml) to learn other options that you have.

Before we begin, it will help to understand the [architecture](/getting-started/deploying-zenml#scenario-3-server-and-database-hosted-in-the-cloud) around the ZenML server and the database that it uses. Now, depending on your setup, you may find one of the following scenarios relevant.

## Option 1: Starting from scratch

If you don't have an existing Kubernetes cluster, you have the following two options to set it up:

- Creating it manually using the documentation for your cloud provider. For convenience, here are links for [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-cluster.html), [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/learn/quick-kubernetes-deploy-portal?tabs=azure-cli) and [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-zonal-cluster#before%5Fyou%5Fbegin).

- Using a [stack recipe](/advanced-guide/practical-mlops) that sets up a cluster along with other tools that you might need in your cloud stack like artifact stores, and secret managers. Take a look at all [available stack recipes](https://github.com/zenml-io/mlops-stacks#-list-of-recipes) to see if there's something that works for you.

> <Note>
>   Once you have created your cluster, make sure that you configure your
>   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) client to talk to
>   it. If you have used stack recipes, this step is already done for you!
> </Note>

You're now ready to deploy ZenML! Run the following command:

```sh
zenml deploy
```

You will be prompted to provide a name for your deployment and details like what cloud provider you want to deploy to, in addition to the username, password and email you want to set for the default user â€” and that's it! It creates the database and any VPCs, permissions and more that is needed.

> <Note>
>   To be able to run the deploy command, you should have your cloud provider's
>   CLI configured locally with permissions to create resources like MySQL
>   databases and networks.
> </Note>

Reasonable defaults are in place for you already and if you wish to configure more settings, take a look at the next scenario that uses a config file.

## Option 2: Using existing cloud resources

### Existing Kubernetes Cluster

If you already have an existing cluster without an ingress controller, you can jump straight to the `deploy` command above to get going with the defaults. Please make sure you have your local `kubectl` configured to talk to your cluster.

**Having an existing NGINX Ingress Controller**

The `deploy` command, by default, tries to create an NGINX ingress controller on your cluster. If you already have an existing controller, you can tell ZenML to not re-deploy it through the use of a config file. This file can be found in the [Configuration File Templates](/getting-started/deploying-zenml/cli#configuration-file-templates) towards the end of this guide. It offers a host of configuration options that you can leverage for advanced use cases.

- Check if an ingress controller is running on your cluster by running the following command. You should see an entry in the output with the hostname populated.

  ```sh
  # change the namespace to any other where
  # you might have the controller installed
  kubectl get svc -n ingress-nginx
  ```

- Set `create_ingress_controller` to `false`.

- Supply your controller's hostname to the `ingress_controller_hostname` variable.

  > <Note>The address should not have a trailing `/`.</Note>

- You can now run the `deploy` command and pass the config file above, to it.
  ```sh
  zenml deploy --config=/PATH/TO/FILE
  ```
  > <Note>
  >   To be able to run the deploy command, you should have your cloud
  >   provider's CLI configured locally with permissions to create resources
  >   like MySQL databases and networks.
  > </Note>

### Existing Hosted SQL Database

If you also already have a database that you would want to use with the deployment, you can choose to configure it with the use of the config file. Here we will demonstrate setting the database.

- Fill the fields below from the config file with values from your database.

  ```
  name: Name of the server deployment.
  provider: The server provider type. # one of aws, gcp or azure
  username: The username for the default ZenML server account.
  password: The password for the default ZenML server account.

  kubectl_config_path: The path to the kubectl config file to use for
      deployment.
  namespace [zenmlserver]: The Kubernetes namespace to deploy the ZenML server to.
  helm_chart: The path to the ZenML server helm chart to use for
      deployment.
  zenmlserver_image_tag [latest]: The tag to use for the ZenML server Docker image.

  create_ingress_controller [true]: Whether to deploy an nginx ingress
      controller as part of the deployment.
  ingress_tls [true]: Whether to use TLS for the ingress.
  ingress_tls_generate_certs [true]: Whether to generate self-signed TLS
      certificates for the ingress.
  ingress_tls_secret_name [zenml-tls-certs]: The name of the Kubernetes secret to use for
      the ingress.
  ingress_path [""]: The path to use for the ingress.
  ingress_controller_hostname: The ingress controller hostname to use for
      the ingress self-signed certificate and to compute the ZenML server
      URL.

  deploy_db [true]: Whether to create a SQL database service as part of the recipe.
  database_username [admin]: The username for the database.
  database_password: The password for the database.
  database_url: The URL of the database to use for the ZenML server.
  database_ssl_ca: The path to the SSL CA certificate to use for the
      database connection.
  database_ssl_cert: The path to the client SSL certificate to use for the
      database connection.
  database_ssl_key: The path to the client SSL key to use for the
      database connection.
  database_ssl_verify_server_cert: Whether to verify the database server
      SSL certificate.

  log_level [ERROR]: The log level to set the terraform client to. Choose one of
      TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN or ERROR (case insensitive).
  ```

- Run the `deploy` command and pass the config file above to it.
  ```sh
  zenml deploy --config=/PATH/TO/FILE
  ```
  > <Note>
  >   To be able to run the deploy command, you should have your cloud
  >   provider's CLI configured locally with permissions to create resources
  >   like MySQL databases and networks.
